The Gamesmakers, Venue Volunteers, and Event Volunteers were responsible for helping with various activities during the Games such as providing information to spectators, controlling access to venues, and manning various events. Media Volunteers were responsible for assisting with broadcasting, media operations, and photography. Volunteers were required to attend training sessions and adhere to a code of conduct, and they were given t-shirts, badges and other necessities. The estimated number of volunteer hours needed to support the 2012 Summer Olympics was massive and required the dedication of a vast number of volunteers.</s>\n"
