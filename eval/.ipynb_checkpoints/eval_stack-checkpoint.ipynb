       "\"When we close only one eye, our brain interprets the lack of input from that eye as darkness because it doesn't receive any visual information to process. But when we close both eyes, our brains combine the two images into one and interpret the combined image as darkness since there isn't enough contrast between the two images for us to be able to make out individual details. This phenomenon is known as binocular vision and helps protect us against blind spots by allowing us to use both eyes together in order to gain better depth perception and detect motion more easily. It also allows us to have a wider field of view compared to if we were using just one eye at a time. In addition, since each eye sees slightly different things depending on what angle it is facing, combining both images can help fill-in missing pieces of detail or detect objects that are closer or further away than what could be detected with just one eye. By closing both eyes, your brain uses all this data to create a single image which appears as pitch black due to the absence of significant contrasts. That being said, some people do still experience ghostly shapes and movement even when they shut their eyes completely; these effects arise from electrical activity happening within the eye itself\""

NP-hard (or NP-completeness) is a complexity class that describes the difficulty of solving a given problem using an NTM. In general, NP-hard problems are those that are extremely difficult or impossible to solve. A problem is said to be NP-hard if it can be reduced to another NP-hard problem in polynomial time. On the other hand, NP-easy (or polynomial-time solvable) problems are those that can be solved in polynomial time using an NTM. So, the terms \"hardness\" and \"easiness\" refer to the difficulty of solving a given problem.\n",
