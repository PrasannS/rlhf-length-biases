Do you have a general synopsis of what they tends to write about?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here’s a brief summary I came across: Brene Brown is a researcher, an author, and an internationally recognized expert on shame, vulnerability, courage, and empathy. She’s spent years studying the human experience of these emotions and the impact of power, connection, and vulnerability.\\n\\nHuman: She has a lot of famous friends, including philosophers who are also best-selling authors.

In some situations, it might be more productive to move on. However, if the two people have been friends for a long time, and they both want to try to solve the problem, I’d recommend trying to resolve the argument.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, that sounds reasonable. We have been friends for about eight years.\\n\\nAssistant: Do you want to try to solve the problem, or do you want to just move on?\\n\\nHuman: I think moving on makes more sense.\\n\\nAssistant: Why is that?\\n\\nHuman: Just because the conflict has been an issue for a long time, and it's beginning to affect both of ours health.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",
       " 'Human: What can you tell me about the industrial revolution?\\n\\nAssistant: The industrial revolution was a shift in the production and use of goods, and involved a variety of complex economic and social changes.\\n\\nHuman: Can you expend upon that?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I'm not sure which ingredients you'd want to use to make it, but the kind of salsa verde that I know of is usually made of chopped up tomatoes, jalapeno, garlic, onion, cilantro, and lime.  Do you want me to write down the ingredients and instructions for this?\\n\\nHuman: Not tomatoes but tomatillos. You almost got all the ingredients right. Looks like you're missing the most crucial ingredient, though\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",
       " \"Human: What are some strategies for solving a crossword puzzle?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, one strategy is to start with the answers to the easy clues, and from there make inferences about the harder ones, and check them against the clues. Another strategy is to use clues that are probably incorrect. It might help to know which ones, so you’re less likely to choose the wrong answer.\\n\\nHuman: I'll look through the clues and try to answer the easy ones that come to mind.\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, I hope this strategy works out for you.\\n\\nHuman: After that I'll try to fill in the smaller boxes and then work my way through the puzzle by looking at the spaces I filled in.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

It became popular in America after German immigrants settled in Wisconsin and Hamburg, NY.\\n\\nHuman: So from there it just spread out?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s about right.  The meat portion of the burger was already being popular in the 1800s.  It’s a tough meat to cook over a fire, so most people made it into patties.  It was around this time that the idea of taking it to the streets started gaining traction.  The sandwiches were still large though, and served on bread.\\n\\nHuman: I bet hamburger was a lot cheaper than it is now too!\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " 'Human: What is a good substitute for coffee\\n\\nAssistant: In terms of caffeine intake, coffee, chocolate, and tea are the most concentrated and provide the most caffeine.  Although there are numerous alternatives such as the cola drinks, such as energy drinks, the caffeine in these drinks isn’t pure caffeine. Instead it is often combined with acids such as citric acid or aspartame, that may stimulate, but also irritate or cause tooth decay.\\n\\nHuman: I want some type of hot drink to help me wake up\\n\\nAssistant: It’s really nice to drink something hot first thing in the morning.  My suggestions are milk or hot chocolate, but they may also be too full of lactose for you, so I could recommend tea or coffee instead.\\n\\nHuman: I dont have a problem with lactose.

The ideal thing to do is to get away from anything that can fall on you, or could throw you, like light fixtures. Is there any place where you could go and be safe? If you could get to your car, and get inside, then that would probably be the safest place.\\n\\nHuman: That's what I thought.

Maleficent?\\n\\nHuman: What is Maleficent?\\n\\nAssistant: Maleficent is an evil sorceress.  She was the original Wicked Witch in the movie The Wizard of Oz.  She eventually gives up her powers to become a human, which is why she doesn’t appear in the Oz movies, but is still very important in the stories.\\n\\nHuman: I don't believe Maleficient is in the WIzard of Oz. She is from Sleeping Beauty.\\n\\nAssistant: Oh, the movie is called Sleeping Beauty? I haven’t seen that movie. I’m sorry for getting her confused.

       " \"Human: what is mosaic down syndrome?\\n\\nAssistant: Mosaic Down syndrome is an incomplete or partial trisomy 21, which means that a parent’s normal chromosome 21 has been copied or doubled in the cells of a fetus. Mosaic Down syndrome is one of several types of Down syndrome, which is a chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. In mosaic Down syndrome, the parent's chromosome 21 is not duplicated entirely, so the child has trisomy 21 in part of their cells but not the rest of them.\\n\\nHuman: okay, so how is it different from down syndrome?\\n\\nAssistant: In Down syndrome, an extra copy of chromosome 21 is present in every cell of the fetus’ body. In mosaic Down syndrome, only part of the cells of the fetus have extra chromosome 21. This means that the child’s mental and physical development may be better than for a child with Down syndrome, or worse. Some of the features of Down syndrome such as obesity, heart defects, and shortened life expectancy may be more likely in mosaic Down syndrome, but others may be less likely.\\n\\nHuman: Is mosaic down syndrome sometimes undiagnosed?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " 'Human: How do you typically write a screenplay to be pitched for a Hollywood movie?\\n\\nAssistant: My best advice is for you to draw up a detailed outline first, because that’s where a good screenplay starts from. You’ll want to work on the outline on its own, and polish it to the point where it flows well and reads coherently. Then you should apply this outline to a scene-by-scene logline of the script, which is a short summary of the script’s plot in a few sentences. To get started, write one scene-by-scene logline at a time, or ten if that feels like too much, until you have about 10-20 of them. You’ll want to focus your attention on writing short, punchy, but accurate and in-depth scene-by-scene loglines, and you’ll be refining your outline as you go along.\\n\\nHuman: Can you explain the main parts of the screenplay?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",
       " 'Human: What are some ways that I can get rid of \"love handles\"?\\n\\nAssistant: A lot of people believe that wearing tighter clothes will get rid of love handles.  But really, love handles are part of the weight that you’re carrying around, and if you need to lose weight, you’ll probably need to cut out a lot of unhealthy calories, and be sure to get regular exercise.\\n\\nHuman: What type of exercises?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " 'Human: Can you help me to understand what stoicism is?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, I think I can! First of all, it’s a philosophy, but it can be applied to almost everything in life. The best definition of stoicism I know is in the book How To Win Friends And Influence People by Dale Carnegie. This book also explains that stoicism is all about controlling your emotions, not letting other people control your emotions, and that it’s also related to positive thinking.\\n\\nHuman: When did stoicism first show up?\\n\\nAssistant: The first written record of stoicism is found in the book Discourses of Epictetus. That was written in approximately 100 A.D. Also, many people are interested in philosophy because of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus, who lived in Greece around 50-120 A.D.\\n\\nHuman: Who are some followers of stoicism?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Where can I find them?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",
       " 'Human: Do kids need to have helmets to ride bicycles nowadays?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, because of the National Standards for bicycle helmets.  Children over the age of four can also use bicycle helmets with visors.\\n\\nHuman: Is it a state law too?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

If you work with a few of them over time, that can lead to an improvement in circulation and endocrine system health.\\n\\nHuman: So focus on the lower back?\\n\\nAssistant: Just concentrate on the tips of the shoulder blades and the bottom of the spine.  You’ll want to make sure that your thumbs don’t touch each other, or they could conflict.  If your palms are facing forward, that should be fine.  Don’t press too hard, and try not to tense your hands.  When you’re doing this, just let your thumbs and fingers work, and listen to your partner for feedback.  If you ask if they’re okay, I bet they’ll say yes.\\n\\nHuman: I'll follow this advice and make sure to apply the right amount of pressure.\\n\\nAssistant: You’ll want to focus the tips of the thumb and little finger on the back where it’s long, and only the thumb and index finger on the spine.  Don’t keep a fixed amount of pressure, since you want to feel the individual pressure points, and work on the muscles and fatigued ligaments.

I’m not sure if there are any that are more specific to a woman’s body composition, but this one is designed for an active lifestyle and promotes endurance.

That said, I do have some ideas for your question about “uniformly cooked” that you might not have considered. You want the inside to be cooked to your liking, but you also don't want it to be too undercooked, and you don't want it to overcook.

Stuffed artichokes are delicious, and I’m glad you asked for that one!\\n\\nArtichokes have a lot of tough skin, so I recommend par-boiling them first.  Place the artichokes in a pot of boiling water for 10-15 minutes.  Then when the artichokes are cool enough to handle, use a sharp knife to cut off the tops and root ends.   You can reserve them for stuffing later, or throw them away, it’s up to you.  Then, use your fingers to spread apart the inner leaves.  You should be able to feel the fuzzy inner leaves, the ones where the stem was attached.  Once you’ve got your hands into the center, you should see the fuzzy center.  Scoop that out, and you can use it for stuffing.  Now that the artichoke is opened, you’re ready to start stuffing it.  \\n\\nIn general, stuffed artichokes can be stuffed with any filling you like, but the classic Sicilian stuffing is this:\\n\\n- 1/3 cup chopped onions\\n- 4 ounces fresh mushrooms, diced\\n- 1 clove garlic, minced\\n- 2 tablespoons chopped parsley\\n- 1 teaspoon salt\\n- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper\\n- 1/2 cup chopped tomatoes\\n- 2 cups spinach leaves, well washed and patted dry\\n\\nTo stuff the artichoke, line the artichoke up to hold it upright, and hold it with the stem side down on the countertop.  Remove any smaller outer leaves and hold the artichoke in place, stem-side down, while you work.  In this position, the outer leaves will act as a sort of plate to hold the stuffing.  Add a few spoonfuls of filling into the center, then fold the outer leaves up like a “roof”.  Add the rest of the filling and then close the artichoke off completely.  Once the artichoke is stuffed, place it in a pot of water and cook for 30 minutes or so until tender.  If you cook it for less time, the artichoke is likely to be too crunchy to be pleasant to eat.\\n\\nHuman: Scooping out the center seems really complicated.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " 'Human: Hi, how does a car engine work?\\n\\nAssistant: The engine has several parts that work together to get a vehicle moving, such as the engine, transmission, engine controls, steering, tires, wheels, and fuel.\\n\\nHuman: I\\'m most interested in knowing what is inside a car motor.\\n\\nAssistant: Inside a car motor, there is a rotating set of coils called the rotor. The rotor is located within the engine casing and is often referred to as the \"rotor\". In a car engine, the rotor is driven by the engine\\'s internal combustion (IC) process. The rotor consists of a rotor core and a number of magnetic poles. Rotors also have windings which are a series of coils used to connect to the electrical system. The windings are installed in slots that allow the windings to move, causing the rotor to turn. The rotor is attached to the engine block by a large set of bolts or studs called studs or clamping bolts.\\n\\nHuman: What does a head gasket inside a car motor do?\\n\\nAssistant: A car motor has an engine block that contains a combustion chamber and cylinder head assembly. The head gasket separates the combustion chamber from the cylinder head, but does not function as a seal. Inside the combustion chamber, the mixture of air and fuel ignites, driving the pistons up and down, while the engine block rotates. The rotating engine block turns the rotor and causes the alternator to produce electricity. The alternator, in turn, charges the battery.\\n\\nHuman: Why do different car motors have a different number of cylinders?\\n\\nAssistant: A car motor has an engine block that contains a combustion chamber and cylinder head assembly. The number of cylinders in an engine depends on the size of the engine, and the design of the engine. For example, an engine with four cylinders is common in automobiles, but an engine with eight cylinders is common in trucks.\\n\\nHuman: Why do trucks have more cylinders in the motor than cars?\\n\\nAssistant: Trucks have a larger engine and larger diameter tires, so they need to be able to provide more power.\\n\\nHuman: Is horsepower of a car higher if there are more cylinders?\\n\\nAssistant: The answer to this question is a bit complicated.  Horsepower is a unit of measure for work performed in one hour.  Horsepower has a formula that includes two components: torque and rpm.  A truck has higher torque and a higher rpm than a car, so it will have a higher horsepower.  It’s also possible to have a high horsepower with a small motor.\\n\\nHuman: What is torque in a car motor?\\n\\nAssistant: The torque (T) of a motor is a measure of the tendency to rotate a mass at a particular speed. It’s measured in Newton meters or kg-m/s. It’s also calculated by the equation T = (force) x (distance), where the force (F) is the mass of the object times its acceleration (a).\\n\\nHuman: Can torque be affected if you have not had an oil change in a long time?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, a car motor with a lot of accumulated dirt or oil can lose torque. It can also have more torque if you replace the oil in the engine with a good quality synthetic oil.\\n\\nHuman: Why does it matter if you get synthetic oil rather than conventional oil in your car?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

There’s a lot of information to sort through.  \\n\\n- The first thing to look for is an insurance company that is rated A+ from AM Best, or Fitch Rating.  You should look at a few of these, and pay attention to their premiums for similar coverage.  In addition, consider how the company has historically behaved with other clients - if the insurer is highly rated by all the rating agencies, you can trust them to handle claims responsibly, and be a partner in providing care.\\n\\n- It is also worth checking if the company’s rates are set on the insurance marketplace.  Some insurers raise premiums based on the customers’ driving history, and by setting rates for similar customers, you can see how much premiums rise or fall based on the type of coverage you choose.\\n\\n- Also, the company should be able to demonstrate that they offer very reasonable pricing for similar customers, and any carrier that asks you to fill out a long and complicated application, or who asks you to demonstrate a significant financial need, will be a “bad fit” for your needs and finances.\\n\\n- Finally, the insurer should offer multiple discounts and protections that can substantially reduce your\\n\\nHuman: What kind of protections?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m not sure I understand your question.

If you're mostly just feeling sluggish, or you think you have a cold, then I would just try to treat it on your own.  There are many products that you can find at the store that can help reduce the symptoms.  Also, getting more rest and drink lots of fluids can help a lot.\\n\\nHuman: I'm not stuck in bed. Can you tell me some of the best products to use then?\\n\\nAssistant: A lot of the products are similar.  You can try taking over-the-counter medicines like Tylenol or DayQuil, or you can take acetaminophen or aspirin.  Taking zinc is also recommended, as it helps boost your immune system.  You can also drink some extra fluids, which will help get rid of any phlegm that might build up.  Some supplements that you can take are Oscillococcinum, vitamin C, Echinacea, or garlic.  These may help reduce the symptoms, but they can be expensive, so you can also try just using the basics.\\n\\nHuman: Great! That's really helpful!\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",
       " \"Human: I am trying to write a fairy tale. What is the most popular plot?\\n\\nAssistant: The most popular plot might be “a princess goes to a faraway land, falls in love, and has a magic genie that grants her wishes”.  We can find plenty of examples of this if we search for fairy tales using the search engine Google.\\n\\nHuman: You can't look anything up on google.\\n\\nAssistant: OK, so let’s think about some other popular fairy tales.\\n\\nHuman: Do you like the plot of Hansel and Gretel?\\n\\nAssistant: Not particularly.\\n\\nHuman: what don't you like?\\n\\nAssistant: I feel like the children do very stupid things.\\n\\nHuman: Should I include a witch on my story?\\n\\nAssistant: I think a witch is a fairly common fairy tale element, so yes.  However, what kind of plotline would you like to pursue?\\n\\nHuman: I was thinking I might pursue a feminist plot for a more modern fairytale.\\n\\nAssistant: I would be happy to help you make your story a more feminist one.  Are you writing a new story, or retelling a traditional one?\\n\\nHuman: I think it would be nice to redo a traditional fairytale and make it feminist.\\n\\nAssistant: Do you want me to help you identify parts of the original fairy tale that you would like to modernize?\\n\\nHuman: yes.\\n\\nAssistant: Great! Can you tell me a little bit more about the story that you want to retell?\\n\\nHuman: I think I want to retell snow white.\\n\\nAssistant: Oh, that’s a classic!   Have you seen the Disney movie?  It’s very romantic.   It tells the story of how a beautiful princess gets married to a charming prince.\\n\\nHuman: yes, except I think I want to have the prince character take the place of the snow white character.\\n\\nAssistant: Gotcha.   So, how does this relate to the plot of the traditional fairy tale?\\n\\nHuman: The prince would be stuck in the woods hiding from the witch and waiting for a princess to come for him.\\n\\nAssistant: This would be a really interesting modern retelling.   Would the witch in the new version be a “toxic feminist” or “man hater”?  Or something else?\\n\\nHuman: The witch could be trying to make the prince give up his traditionally female characteristics and turn him into a bad person.\\n\\nAssistant: This sounds like a really interesting modern retelling of the story!\\n\\nHuman: How should I remake the characters of the seven dwarves?\\n\\nAssistant: I wonder what they represent in the original story.   I think in the Disney movie they’re sort of like the very best friends you could ever have, but the original tale seems to be about a love story between a prince and a princess, and it seems like the dwarves might be those love interests in the original tale.   Is that right?\\n\\nHuman: I think they are friends. Perhaps the seven dwarves could just be seven friends the prince has?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, I think that sounds good!   What do you think the seven dwarves represent?\\n\\nHuman: They are named after personality traits or moods mostly, so I think each friend could be overtly different in a specific way.\\n\\nAssistant: I think that would work really well for a story about having friends as the main focus.   Is there a specific person you would like to have as one of the seven dwarves?\\n\\nHuman: I can't think of a popular person to use as a character. Can you?\\n\\nAssistant: I think we should start by creating the seven dwarves individually, then think about who might fit into each of the roles.  I think for the first one, we could use someone like Elvis.\\n\\nHuman: probably not Elvis but its a good thought.\\n\\nAssistant: OK, if not Elvis, then how about Michael Jackson?\\n\\nHuman: Not Michael Jackson either.\\n\\nAssistant: Alright, let’s think about some different choices.  Do you have any ideas for who the person might be?  Maybe an idea for a specific fictional character that you like?\\n\\nHuman: It may have to be a cliche of a person or trope.\\n\\nAssistant: For example, who would you pick if you wanted to use the seven dwarves as an analogue for the seven virtues or the seven deadly sins?\\n\\nHuman: That's actually not a bad idea.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

The amount is often stated in a unique unit called a “trifecta box”. For example, if you win, and your price was $1.30, then your winnings would be 30 units.\\n\\nHuman: Then what is an exacta?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The US Constitution draws a lot from the English.\\n\\nHuman: So France didn\\'t have much influence?\\n\\nAssistant: That is correct.  France\\'s best influence on the US was in law, with respect to the Declaration of Independence, which is a prominent example of American Common Law.  It also became the standard source of many US legal terms and concepts, and so the US adopted many French legal terms for the English translations, for example \"defense\" instead of \"de fense\".\\n\\nHuman: Did the U.S. approve upon the British system in any ways?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " 'Human: why are vaccinations important?\\n\\nAssistant: Because vaccines allow people to get sick, but still live healthy, productive lives. In the absence of vaccines, one of the most common ways children in the US get very sick is through the respiratory disease measles. In the absence of vaccines, people sometimes get very sick with measles, and more than half of those people die from measles. This means that many children and adults are tragically killed every year in the United States through the disease measles.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, should I take all of the recommended ones?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s really hard to answer that question! The best available evidence for the most effective combination of vaccines is in the table below, which combines studies of cost-effectiveness and epidemiological studies of vaccine effectiveness. If you don’t read too much into the table, one thing that you can take away from it is that vaccines work, and you are definitely better off getting vaccinated.  This table is in fact an abridged version of a longer table that I have access to.  If you’d like, I can provide a link to a more comprehensive table.\\n\\nHuman: Any other ideas?\\n\\nAssistant: Would it be helpful for me to also just summarize the benefits and risks of the recommended vaccines?  Here’s what I’ve got:\\n\\nThere are many types of vaccines for many diseases, but here I’m just going to talk about the main ones.  Vaccines prevent or reduce the risk of many diseases in people including the common cold, measles, pneumonia, whooping cough (whooping cough is also called “pertussis”), meningitis, tetanus, diphtheria, polio, and chickenpox.  The process of getting vaccines works a bit like this:  One of the main things that make vaccines work is they stimulate the immune system to make antibodies that attack and fight the germs that cause the diseases.  So, if you get vaccinated, that means that your immune system gets a head start on protecting you from these diseases.  As a result, you are less likely to get sick from the diseases, and if you do get sick you are less likely to die.  This means that you’re much better off getting the vaccines than not getting them, as long as you do the right thing about when and how much.

So it is easier to mix the cement with straw and put the mixture into the cracks between the bricks.\\n\\nHuman: Any other advice?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

(Remember to keep them facing the same way so you can tell which ones are right side out.)

What I mean is that the door potentially has cracks or slight openings around the door frame and thats where the cold comes in\\n\\nAssistant: The easy solution is to repaint your door, or even replace it.  You can also try weatherstripping your door.\\n\\nHuman: Repainting the door wouldn't help. But weather-stripping may! Can you explain further?\\n\\nAssistant: Weather-stripping consists of using thin strips of rubber to seal gaps around the edges of a door, or in other places where air may enter.  Since there is a gap around your door, weather-stripping would help.  But it is best to be sure about the exact location of the gaps in the door before you install the weather-stripping, to prevent any sharp protrusions from catching the rubber when the door is closed.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, I will look into it. Thanks!\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",
       " 'Human: What are shallots?\\n\\nAssistant: Shallots are the long, narrow, flat root of a species of Allium plant, like garlic, onion, or leek. They are also called “eschalots” or “escallions”, and are often used in French cooking. They are sometimes called “garlic onions”, which means they can be a substitute for garlic or onions, but usually taste different. The shape of a shallot is close to that of a scallion, though they are larger, longer, and more curved.\\n\\nHuman: What are some dishes that make use of shallots?\\n\\nAssistant: Shallots are usually cooked in water or broth, though some cooks prefer to boil them whole in the manner of onions. There are a number of dishes that use shallots, including some variations on the classic French shallot vinaigrette, which is normally used on salads. In British and Irish cooking, shallots are sometimes mixed with cold potatoes to make “tatties and neeps” or “tatties and mash”, and sometimes stuffed into a sausage casing with other ingredients, to make “Scotch eggs”. They are also often added to omelettes, including the French “omelette mayonnaise”. They are commonly used to enhance a sauce, especially for steaks, and are sometimes used in many stocks and broths, especially in French cuisine. They are also used to flavour mayonnaise, making it tastier, and are also used to flavour tomato sauce, such as a spaghetti or pizza sauce. They can also be used to flavour wine, such as French wines that would traditionally have been seasoned with garlic.\\n\\nHuman: Can you give me a recipe for a Red Wine Shallot sauce?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " \"Human: Why can flies always find their way into a window but never back outside?\\n\\nAssistant: There’s an entire field of research about fly navigation that relates to the reason. It is done by sensing and interpreting the “wind” of sound energy, to orient in 3-dimensional space.\\n\\nHuman: What did the research show?\\n\\nAssistant: Insects have three types of sensory structures: mechanosensitive “hairs”, chemoreceptors and other mechanosensitive cells on their legs that can sense both air currents and the chemical profile of the air in the immediate vicinity, and in different combinations, they can allow insects to “home” in on a source of chemical food and also to adjust their position in response to wind and other local weather conditions. The legs of insects are also much smaller than the wings, which contributes to stability. It is believed that insects may not be able to fly in an air current. For example, flies have evolved to have shorter legs than most insects, which also enable them to make rapid adjustments in flight direction, and lower flying speeds (allowing them to navigate through wind). They rely more on short-range navigation, such as pheromones, than long-range navigation like the sonar of bats, which are adapted for flying. There is a group of special microorganisms in insects, called “non-mobile” flagellates, which act as both chemical and mechanical sensors in insects, and some of these bacteria live within the fly’s internal organs, such as the uterus.\\n\\nHuman: I don't believe that. Flies lay eggs, so they don't have uteri.\\n\\nAssistant: Human: ... Actually, in flies the tissues of the reproductive organs are really close to the urinary and digestive tracts.\\n\\nHuman: Ok, but I don't think they have a uterus.\\n\\nAssistant: Human: http://www.biological.net/botany/flies.html “Flies lay eggs in a hollow on the ground or in any dark, moist place.  When the eggs hatch, the larvae or maggots emerge and crawl away in search of food.  After eating, the larva swells and pupates in a casing of their own silk.  When the flies emerge they are called either “maggots” or “grubs”.”\\n\\nHuman: Okay, but you didn't explain why they would have a uterus.

I'm not sure what the benefits of brushing first would be, you could get floss down your throat that way.  The only problem with brushing first is that you might not be able to floss out the things you brush.

       " 'Human: How do solar panels work?\\n\\nAssistant: There are two main types of solar panels, monocrystalline silicon panels and polycrystalline silicon panels. In monocrystalline silicon panels, the silicon is grown in a single crystal form, so all of the layers have the same crystalline structure. This is important, because the different layers can be controlled very precisely to obtain the exact orientation of the atoms in the crystal. Because the layers have exactly the same crystal structure, all of the layers have the same conductivity and voltage. The top layer is used as the negative electrode, and the bottom layer is used as the positive electrode. The middle layer is called the intrinsic layer, because it contains the other layers and the ions that move within the cell. \\n\\nPolycrystalline silicon solar panels, on the other hand, are made from individual crystals grown in a random, non-controlled way. These crystals are then glued together. Because the crystals have non-uniform crystal structures, the layers have non-uniform conductivity and voltage. This means that the top layer is used as the negative electrode, the middle layer is used as the positive electrode, and the bottom layer is used as a diode.\\n\\nThe exact thickness of the layer is dependent on the efficiency of the solar panel. An ideal\\n\\nHuman: Does that mean monocrystalline silicon panels are better than polycrystalline ones?\\n\\nAssistant: For most uses, a polycrystalline silicon panel will be much more efficient.\\n\\nHuman: But others say otherwise, that monocrystalline ones are more efficient, though it comes with a higher price.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",
       " 'Human: What is a POS system?\\n\\nAssistant: Pos (point of sale) is a commonly used term for “point of sale” -- a retail store counter that lets a customer pay for the purchase. The term often is used in retail, where someone is “managing the POS” or just “managing the store” -- by selling things to customers, taking money from them, and keeping track of their purchases. The same applies to things like a restaurant’s counter, where someone is behind it taking customers’ money, and giving change.\\n\\nHuman: And how does it communicate with a credit or debit card provider?\\n\\nAssistant: Good question!  POS systems often communicate with a credit card provider using the small piece of plastic which a customer gives you in exchange for the ability to buy something. This card usually connects to the merchant\\'s phone line, and that phone line will often connect to the internet. At that point, the information on the card is often transmitted through a series of computers, and eventually it gets to the merchant’s bank (or the bank of the merchant’s business partners), where the bank can access the information it has on that customer, like the credit card company. For larger purchases, the bank itself might contact the credit card company.\\n\\nHuman: So if a store loses its internet connection, the POS system won\\'t work?\\n\\nAssistant: Exactly!  If a computer is on the internet, and the internet isn’t working, then the computer cannot talk to a server which it needs to talk to, which is why the internet connection is important.  Many POS systems will have a backup mode where the device can be connected to the internet using a wire (called “wired connectivity”), and that method is commonly used to let the system work even if the internet goes down.  Sometimes, too, the internet is down because of “technological issues” on the internet, like a big website that is under construction.  Since these POS systems are generally not connected to a website on the internet, they can keep working even if the internet is down, although the technical work to re-establish the internet connection can take a while.\\n\\nHuman: And how do the \"tap\" POS systems, where you don\\'t have to swipe your card but just touch it to the machine, work?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

I think you’d need to cook them longer.  You could try moving the pan farther away from the flame, or cooking them on a flame that’s not so hot, or not using as much heat from the flame.  Or you could find another method to cook them, like steaming them.

So the section of the article you’re asking about starts like this:\\n\\nFrom colonial times to the early 20th century, the United States was a majority-white country, with nearly 80% of its citizens white.  By 1920, more than 95% of US citizens were white.  At the turn of the 20th century, most people of African descent (including people of African, West Indian, and Middle Eastern descent) were enslaved.  While slavery legally ended in 1865 with the end of the Civil War, in reality most of the 11 million people of African descent were not free.  During Reconstruction, some African Americans were free; others were landless and poor.  Many of them migrated to cities and started working for wages. \\n\\nThe majority of people of African descent lived in the South, and experienced racial terror during the first decades of the 20th century, including lynching, racial violence, and race riots.  Racial terror against blacks peaked in the first two decades of the 20th century.\\n\\nHuman: Do you agree or disagree with the article?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The term “hyperloop” was coined by Elon Musk in a whitepaper he wrote in August 2013, and he has subsequently discussed the concept in interviews and at conferences.\\n\\nHuman: What about the humanoid he is building?\\n\\nAssistant: Elon Musk recently made a website for an upcoming robot which he calls “Doopie.”  He has described the robot as follows: “We’re currently in the process of building a robot that we will make publicly available. It will be able to do some chores, move around, maybe even drive a car, but its most important function will be to allow a person to interact with a machine without the need for a screen. We’ll be able to see the same thing the robot is seeing and talk to it and have a conversation with it.”\\n\\nHuman: I thought the robot was named \"Optimus\"?\\n\\nAssistant: This is true, he has also recently proposed the name \"Optimus\" for the robot, and has said that this will be the final name for it.\\n\\nHuman: Any other significant A.I. related facts about Musk?\\n\\nAssistant: Elon Musk founded a project called OpenAI, and he is also active in research in the field of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

       " \"Human: How can I shrink jeans without a dryer?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, they won’t shrink in the dryer, as the heat and humidity will just make them wet.  So you’ll have to buy a set of “shrinkers” or “ball shrinkers” from a department store.  Then you’ll have to “shrink them” by putting them in the dryer on a very low heat setting, with no heat, just cold air.  But it’s best to use a washing machine, and then use a very long cycle, and cool the clothes in the dryer.  But the important thing is not to heat them with a hair dryer or anything, they can only be heated by the heat of the dryer.  Then when the jeans are dry, you can try ironing them, but they’ll be more easily ironed when they’re dry.\\n\\nHuman: I've never heard of ball shrinkers.

I have some good advice for you here:\\n\\n-   Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day\\n-   Avoid heavy meals at night\\n-   Set an alarm to wake up a little before you normally do\\n-   Use the same pillow, sheet, and duvet\\n-   Avoid strong light in the evening\\n-   Avoid caffeine and alcohol\\n-   Avoid nicotine\\n-   Keep your bedroom dark and cool\\n-   Avoid naps during the day\\n\\nHuman: That's pretty good, but my schedule isn't the same every day which makes my sleep schedule inconsistent\\n\\nAssistant: That's an important issue.

       " 'Human: Why is almost everyone afraid of snakes?\\n\\nAssistant: We can’t know for sure, but a common theory is that people once learned that snakes were dangerous by being bitten by one.  Another theory is that people are afraid of snakes in general because, in many species, they can do harm, even when they aren’t venomous.\\n\\nHuman: Maybe we are hard wired to fear certain animals?\\n\\nAssistant: There is a lot of evidence to support the idea that humans are biologically programmed to fear certain animals.  Fossil records show that humans have coexisted with many different types of animals for a very long time, and there is also clear evidence that humans have been at war with other humans since ancient times.  So it’s possible that both biological and cultural factors played a role in human attitudes towards dangerous animals.\\n\\nHuman: I wonder what it is about snakes in general though?\\n\\nAssistant: We don’t have a definitive answer for that.  There are several hypotheses though, including the idea that snakes can slither more easily into dark places and can escape quickly, and also that they can be venomous in a way that humans are especially sensitive to.  And it’s also possible that other snakes are just more scary-looking than other animals.\\n\\nHuman: That all makes sense when you think about it.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Your doctor will look for symptoms, but you are always looking for symptoms. A general physical will determine what your symptoms are. A doctor would determine the following during a physical: your blood pressure, any pain you might have, your heart, whether your abdomen is hard, and whether your lungs, liver, kidneys, and bowel movements are healthy.  However, just going to a doctor once a year does not mean that you won’t get cancer. It is, however, a good way to catch it early if you have cancer.\\n\\nHuman: How much do general physicals cost for uninsured people?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " 'Human: How does the human body know where to grow things like hair and nails?\\n\\nAssistant: The basic blueprint for human hair and nails is in your DNA, but you have to actually make them. Cells grow hair or nails by building proteins that are specialized for creating that structure, and then they use these proteins to make the final structures.\\n\\nHuman: How does DNA affect processes in the human body like growing hair and nailss?\\n\\nAssistant: The genetic code is stored in your DNA and controls what types of proteins are made.  The proteins then go on to build hair, nails, bones, organs, and so on.\\n\\nHuman: How does the genetic code in DNA differentiate between growing organs and bones?\\n\\nAssistant: When you create proteins, you do it in response to a specific stimulus from your environment.  In your body, the types of proteins created are highly dependent on the type of environment you’re in.  Your environment also affects the sequences of proteins.  So for example, if you are in a really dry environment, you might create proteins that help your body hold water better, and that’s why skin gets thicker.  If you’re in a really moist environment, you might create proteins that increase the amount of oil in your skin.\\n\\nHuman: Interesting! And how often are your cells replacing old ones?\\n\\nAssistant: There are millions of cells in your body that are constantly being replaced.  That’s why some people have wrinkly skin: it’s just the skin cells they’ve replaced.  Cells in your body also have limits to how long they’re going to live, which can mean some cells die without any replacement.  For example, in the brain, cells are constantly dying.  But the brain also grows new ones that replace them.  This is how your brain stays the same size from one day to the next, and is also why people can get brain damage or have certain diseases, and start acting differently.\\n\\nHuman: How does the body remove the dead or dying cells?\\n\\nAssistant: Your body cleans out dead cells through a process called \"autophagy\".  In this process, your cells break down dead cells or parts of them and then take that material out.  This means it’s not just a problem with dead skin cells, but also with cells in other parts of your body like your brain and muscles.  The immune system can also help with the process of removing dead or dying cells by killing certain types of cells in your body.\\n\\nHuman: So it\\'s almost like your body recycles its cells, right?\\n\\nAssistant: This is a great example of how your body uses its environment to make decisions and do things.  It’s also an important function of your body, because the more specialized your cells are, the less efficient you’ll be at using them, and it’s the cells that you need to do things like running and digesting your food.  A lot of your body’s processes involve making decisions about which things are needed and which things aren’t, which means that the way cells are replaced and maintained depends on how your environment is affecting them.\\n\\nHuman: So, if your body is constantly making new cells, why does age negatively affect things like motor skills, response time, and the color present in hair?\\n\\nAssistant: In the last few questions we’ve been talking about autophagy, which is a type of removal that happens within your body.  Aging also affects the production of new cells, which means that your body isn’t producing new cells to replace the ones that have died, so the cells that are left are the ones that were originally there.  When a cell is new, it also has certain characteristics like greater energy levels and more efficient functions.  After the cell has been around for a while, it uses less energy to perform the same actions, and it’s also less capable of performing certain tasks.  For example, cells in your hair are constantly getting replaced, and some older people will notice their hair getting grayer.\\n\\nHuman: Does a higher level of stress make it more difficult for cells in the body to function at their highest level?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

These fabrics are wash-and-wear, resistant to mold, bacteria and mildew, and will keep looking fresh and new longer.\\n\\nMost importantly: always try to make a habit of separating your laundry by material type (cotton, wool, etc.) and stain type (e.g. white, dark, red, etc.). Then, if you can, wash your clothes separately by type and only if you’re sure your machine can handle it. Try to wear whites and darks in separate loads, for example. That way you’ll be able to use less energy, water, and detergent, and your clothes will stay clean and keep their shape.\\n\\nI hope this helps!\\n\\nHuman: This is helpful.

A little dirt goes in the center, and a bit of plywood goes on top.  There’s a small hole in the center where the rabbit can go in and out.

It is especially helpful for children to learn music because music is central to most cultures. In addition to the emotions that music inspires, there are also some physical benefits. Music enhances creativity and improves language abilities. Music also has many educational benefits, such as helping to create listening skills and aiding in the learning of rhythmic languages, such as French and Spanish. It is also important for your child’s social development.

The food is cooked in vacuum-sealed pouches.  The advantage is that it makes food more evenly cooked.  Another advantage is that it can preserve food for longer than other methods, like storing it in the refrigerator or freezing it.\\n\\nHuman: Oh okay. Can I it in my home?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, you can set up a sous-vide bath in your home.  There are also commercial devices that you can rent.  In general, you want to set up a cooking box with a vacuum system, then place the food inside and cook it at the right temperature.  Sometimes you might just want to heat the water to the right temperature, and then put the food inside, since there’s no need for vacuum sealing.\\n\\nHuman: What kind of food is it best for?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

He is an American, and has been a professional player since he was in high school, which is an unusual choice for a very talented high school student. He is named after his father who, ironically, played college basketball at a small university in North Carolina, and had a short stint in the NBA, before being drafted for military service in Korea. But he suffered a significant shoulder injury that ended his basketball career, and led to a long and painful recovery process. He ended up working in the tire business, until the family suffered economic hardship, and he took a job as a sportscaster.\\n\\nHuman: Is there anyone else more famous than Michael Jordan in basketball?\\n\\nAssistant: No, he is considered the best player of all time, and so no one is considered as successful as he has been.  There are some other very good players in the NBA.  This is because the NBA has a regular season where teams can play different players in different roles.  The season also has playoffs, and the best teams in the league are invited to the championship finals, which are held over several games.  To be the best player, you need to be able to play against different kinds of players, as well as having an understanding of what your team needs, and a good understanding of the game.\\n\\nHuman: Who is better, Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

It’s been nearly twenty years since the International Astronomical Union (IAU) decided that Pluto no longer met the criteria for being a planet, and since then, humanity has still not resolved how they want to categorize it.  To make matters more complicated, there are multiple groups that have recently been arguing that “Planet Nine” exists, but who knows how long it will take to decide whether or not they were right.\\n\\nHuman: What are the criteria for being a planet?\\n\\nAssistant: There’s a set of rules and definitions that are used to categorize objects like planets.  For example, a planet must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit, and this is to make sure we don’t accidentally add other objects into the planet category like asteroids or space debris.  Also, a planet must be massive enough that it doesn’t just orbit the sun but that it is in a separate orbit and thus not affected by the sun’s gravity.\\n\\nHuman: So what was it about Pluto that didn't fit the criteria?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

What are those different reasons?\\n\\nAssistant: A driver is used to hit the ball the farthest, for people who like to hit the ball straight and far away.  A fairway wood is used to hit the ball through the air, to help a player get to the green.  A hybrid club is used to hit the ball from different areas of the fairway.  A putter is used to hit the ball the shortest distance into the hole, to help a player get the ball into the cup.  And a wedge is used to hit the ball in between the green and the hole, to help a player come close to the hole.\\n\\nHuman: What are the clubs with numbers on them?\\n\\nAssistant: Each of the clubs has a “loft” measurement, which is the angle of the clubface when it is at rest.  These measurements increase from number one to number five.  The smallest club, the one with the smallest loft, is a one-iron.  The next one, the two-iron, has a slightly larger loft, and so on.  The club with the largest loft is called the five-iron, or a driver, because it has a loft about one-and-a-half times as large as that of the four-iron.\\n\\nHuman: What are those one to five numbered clubs used for?\\n\\nAssistant: Golfers play with various clubs throughout the course, because they may need different clubs for different parts of the course.  For example, the driver is only used on the tee.  Players need a club with a larger loft, such as a four-iron, to hit the ball from the fairway to the green.   They use a three-wood on the green, to hit the ball a short distance from the hole.  And then they use a putter to hit the ball the shortest distance into the cup.  So the numbers on the golf clubs refer to the loft, or the angle of the clubface when it is at rest.  More and more golfers are choosing to switch to longer clubs, or “drivers,” so the differences between the clubs will become less obvious as the game continues.\\n\\nHuman: How does loft affect the distance a ball goes?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The second common strategy is to buy popular items or products at a popular store, so that you will have plenty of competition from other shoppers and the items you want will go on sale, but then you have to deal with the crowds and with lots of people.

       " 'Human: what are benefits of watching puppet shows for kids?\\n\\nAssistant: The research literature shows that puppet shows can be helpful for children in a number of ways, particularly because of the way they’re organized around children’s attention, and the repetition and structural structure that enable them to be easily remembered and accessed.\\n\\nHuman: Any other ideas?\\n\\nAssistant: Kids might have fun with the puppets and their stories, but the main reason they’re used is to learn words and concepts from experts.  When presented with different types of puppet shows, the kids learn more quickly with the well-designed ones.  If they’re given the chance to choose between a puppet show that explains a new concept or a picture book, the puppets tend to be more effective.  Puppet shows work best when they’re used in conjunction with a parent who’s encouraging and reinforcing the learning.  For children who are advanced learners, they might also be used to build on concepts and topics that have been introduced previously.\\n\\nHuman: That actually sounds really useful.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Steve Jobs was confident, competitive, and pushed people.  Steve Wozniak was superficially charming, naive, and really driven by finding new ideas to build.  This was the beginning of Apple.  After starting the firm in 1976, Jobs and Wozniak sold the first Apple I computers to hobbyists.  This was the beginning of the Apple computer company.  You could play games on the Apple I, and it was a hobby computer.  Steve Jobs was a tremendous marketer, and he sold the Apple I to all of his friends, and their friends.  By this point, Jobs and Wozniak were getting into business trouble because of this excessive business relationship.  Wozniak would leave, and Jobs would bring him back.  Both of them were focused on computers, and not on running a business.  By the early 1980s, they were running out of money.

Let’s begin with some general facts about the revolution itself, and then we can go into detail about different aspects of this interesting time period.  The revolution began with a rising of the workers, called the Russian Revolution of 1905.  For the most part the rising failed and the autocracy of the Czar was strengthened, but this failure in turn led to a popular disillusionment with the idea of socialism.  The reasons for this disillusionment with the socialist idea were both ideological and economic.  The failing of the revolution left many radicals and anarchists in a state of poverty and personal despair.  The situation was made worse by the fact that the working class were forced to continue to serve in the army even as the government used that army to suppress their political ideas.  However, just as the workers and radicals had mostly turned away from socialist politics, the political situation had also turned against socialism, and anti-socialist sentiment grew in popularity.  This popularity caused the Russian government to tighten their police control over opposition to the government and to put more effort into stamping out radical ideas in society.\\n\\nThe\\n\\nHuman: What happened to the Romanov family after the Revolution and abdication of Nicholas?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The original The Artist is a lovely example of “silent” film.  The tension between its actors speaks a thousand words, with not a sound coming from its soundtrack.  Another beautiful example would be The Red Shoes, a fable from the ‘30s, which is a silent movie with excellent sound effects.  (The fable’s essence was such that it is still worthy of our attention.)  I personally recommend a movie that blends a story with film “music”: The Stunt Man.  It is a delightful mix of characters and plot twists in a movie that might be described as “thriller with a slow, tragic burn” if you are trying to capture the movie’s essence.  The best feature of the movie is its cinematography and soundtrack, which are “classic” by modern standards.  So if you find a way to access this movie, you will find yourself rewarded with a movie that stands above the countless other films of its time and continues to be appreciated today.\\n\\nHuman: The Artist seems like a great modern silent movie.

I’d suggest avoiding alcohol in general to be safer.\\n\\nHuman: Well, I hear you, although sometimes we like to imbibe. So, sounds like both are equally valued nutritionally, overall?\\n\\nAssistant: I think you’re referring to their nutritional value.  Alcohol contains both calories and a variety of nutrients, and some people think that some of the health benefits of alcohol are because it contains nutrients, even though they’re small amounts.  You might enjoy this article on Harvard Health on the health benefits of alcohol.\\n\\nHuman: I hear you, but I trust you to give me the general thrust of the article?\\n\\nAssistant: It seems to me that the author of the article is more concerned with getting the proper nutritional balance, and that alcohol could be part of a healthy diet.\\n\\nHuman: In moderation, I think alcohol can be a good addition to any diet.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

Your motivation might be saving your health, the health of your family, or a desire to live in a smoke-free world.  Your motivation can be anything that gives you the internal drive to give up.\\n\\nHuman: Please give me smoking cessation methods.\\n\\nAssistant: There are many good methods for smoking cessation. Here is a good summary:\\n\\n-   Talk to your friends and family and think about how you’re spending your time. Think about your reasons to start smoking in the first place and if there’s any reason that keeps you from stopping.\\n-   Start with a plan for how you will change your behavior. Set a stop date for yourself, and try to make it far enough in the future that you can prepare for it. Set up a quit date with your support network (family, friends, doctor) and tell them how you plan to do it.  \\n-   Keep your commitments. This is your chance to really plan how you will handle all the cravings and stressors that will come up while quitting. Keep in mind your commitment to yourself and your loved ones.\\n-   Get support. As you’re thinking about quitting, you’ll need to start setting up support systems for yourself. People that you can go to when the going gets tough, whether it’s a friend, family member, or the doctor that you have made your quit date with.  \\n-   You might need to start talking with your loved ones and family about your reasons for quit\\n\\nHuman: Okay and what are some tools I can use to help me stop smoking?\\n\\nAssistant: There are many great tools that can help you stop smoking.  However, there are only a few that work for everyone.  \\n-   Nicotine replacement therapies like gums or patches. These methods of delivering nicotine are popular, but are also known for causing addiction relapse. \\n-   Cutting down your smoking habit. If you’re still smoking, then you’re going to be addicted to smoking. So one step to quitting is to cut down the amount of cigarettes you smoke every day.  The less you smoke, the less nicotine you’ll be getting in your system and your chances of successful quitting increase. \\n-   Another great method is to wean yourself off of nicotine.  As you cut down on the number of cigarettes you smoke every day, you’re also reducing your nicotine intake.  By the time your quit day rolls around, you’ll be in the process of weaning off of nicotine.\\n\\nHuman: Great, thanks.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

What can you tell me about them?\\n\\nAssistant: Salem was an important center of the American religious and social movements of the 18th century. The 18th century was also a time of social and political upheaval, which sometimes manifested itself in violence. In 1692, in Salem, Massachusetts, a small group of people were accused of using magic and witchcraft. There was a panic. People suspected their neighbors of witchcraft. An hysteria set in and people were threatened and even killed. In the end twenty people were hung. Can you say more about why you are interested in this topic?\\n\\nHuman: What made the people suspect they were witches?\\n\\nAssistant: One reason might have been that there were a lot of very strange happenings at the time. In addition to people being accused of witchcraft, many people reported experiences with animal familiars, mystical events, strange voices, and possessions.\\n\\nHuman: Why was this happening?\\n\\nAssistant: It may have been related to cultural tensions at the time. In Puritan times, strong beliefs in a supernatural reality were very strong.\\n\\nHuman: What did the group of people accused do to drive people to believe the only solution to the problem would be to hang them?\\n\\nAssistant: Many of them appeared to have performed magic that involved innocent children. In addition to that, there were many reports of animal familiars which were unusual. Also people had seen strange shapes and lights in the sky. It was thought that they were witches.\\n\\nHuman: None of that sounds violent. Did they have any proof of the incidences?\\n\\nAssistant: In the end some of the accused were able to prove their innocence by telling the truth about events and identifying the true criminals. In some cases the group members were executed by the public and then hanged by the authorities. In other cases the group members were hanged by the authorities after being convicted in a court of law.\\n\\nHuman: It sounds tragic.Thanks for the info.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

Niepce's “camera obscura” was used to produce an image of a section of the Notre Dame in Paris, although the process was never patented by Niepce.

It provides various tools for web developers, such as automatic database structure creation, and helpers to allow for easy rendering of HTML and other web content.\\n\\nHuman: How long does it take to learn?\\n\\nAssistant: There are many guides to learning RoR online.  It’s possible to learn in a week or two, though it can be difficult to get the hang of without a mentor or teacher.  It’s also possible to learn as much as you want on your own, though there will be additional resources you could benefit from.\\n\\nHuman: Would you need to have experience with any other frameworks or coding experience to learn the basic concepts of RoR?\\n\\nAssistant: RoR is a very high-level web framework, which means it will be easier to learn and will require less experience with other frameworks or coding languages.  I think it would be good for you to at least know some HTML and CSS, but if you don’t you’ll be able to pick it up just fine.\\n\\nHuman: Are HTML and CSS basic development skills?\\n\\nAssistant: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the basic formatting language for most web pages.  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language for describing the formatting of various aspects of a web page.  It’s not difficult to learn, and is a prerequisite to learning RoR.\\n\\nHuman: Okay. Are there any other prerequisites to learning RoR?\\n\\nAssistant: You should know at least some of the basics of the RoR framework.  If you’ve already learned and can apply the basics of RoR to a project, you may be able to do pretty much anything on the RoR framework.  I’d recommend reading some of the RoR tutorials online, and completing a simple project.\\n\\nHuman: And can you tell me more about automatic database structure creation?\\n\\nAssistant: RoR comes with a command line interface for creating an object-oriented database schema from data you provide.  It can create all the tables needed to support the application, and it can create the scaffolding for views.  This can save you quite a bit of time.  I think it’s important to learn some database basics anyway, because many RoR application use the database as a core part of the application.\\n\\nHuman: What do people use these database schemas for?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The Navy is a department of the Department of Defense, which also oversees the Marines.  The Navy includes the Marine Corps, and the Marines operate independently within the Navy and also under the Department of the Navy.\\n\\nHuman: So the Navy oversees the Marines?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, the Navy oversees the Marine Corps.\\n\\nHuman: How did that start?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, there are a few ways to approach that question.  One thing you can do is to say that the US Marines started with a tradition of maritime military activity, and that history started in the 18th century and eventually, eventually came to be a part of the US Navy.  It’s also possible to say that the US Marines were originally formed separately, and that they are now a part of the US Navy.  So the best answer for this question, I think, is that the US Marines started in a way that would now make them a part of the US Navy.  They were part of the Department of the Navy in 1868, and they’ve had a more formalized relationship since around the 1880s.  That’s what it boils down to.\\n\\nHuman: Ah.

       " 'Human: What are some good artists from the 1920s?\\n\\nAssistant: Alright, I can give you some suggested names and a description of their artwork.  The painter Vincent Van Gogh was an important artist in the late 1800s, who focused on what we call “Expressionist” art.  He believed that the artist should reflect their feelings in their art, rather than trying to describe them.  That means that there will often be very high emotion or intensity in his paintings.  And an interesting result of this is that some people don’t really like Van Gogh’s paintings.  For instance, when you Google his painting The Starry Night, you’ll see lots of people sharing photos of it on social media saying things like “I hate this painting” and “It’s gross.”  Other people find the high emotion of the painting intriguing or refreshing, and enjoy it.  So when thinking about a Van Gogh painting, keep in mind that he might have painted something you find exciting, but other people might find it upsetting.  For instance, let’s say you found the painting Starry Night exciting.  Some of the other paintings I’ll mention could be similar to Starry Night, so be prepared to see some pretty intense artworks.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, I meant musical artists.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " 'Human: How do I keep pipes from freezing in the winter?\\n\\nAssistant: When cold air enters your house, it contracts and this pulls heat out of your pipes.  If you open the valve of your water heater enough, the water will stay warm and flowing to your faucets, radiators and other appliances, so that your pipes don’t freeze.  Unfortunately, this means you’ll also use more water than you’re used to.  As an alternative, you can insulate your pipes and heat them directly, so they remain warm even if your house is cold.  Here’s some helpful advice for DIY insulation, but check with an expert before you do anything.\\n\\nHuman: How do I insulate the pipes?\\n\\nAssistant: If you’re able to work with some mechanical skills, you could build a water heater insulator yourself.  You’ll need a plastic sheet, a layer of foam insulation, and some baffles (pipe-shaped objects) and mounting hardware to hold everything together.  If you’d rather not do that, you can hire a professional to do the work for you.\\n\\nHuman: What other methods can I use to keep the pipes from freezing?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

For example, if you were to put some peanut butter on toast with a small amount of jam on top, it makes the jam spread out and really shine through, and it makes it feel like you’re having two different, delicious flavors together.  It makes a fantastic combination!\\n\\nHuman: Do you think it is because one is sweet and the other is salty?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s true too, and one way of describing why that works is that sweetness is perceived to be a “lower” taste on the tongue, and salt is perceived to be a “higher” taste on the tongue, and that makes them feel like they’re “going” well together.\\n\\nHuman: Do you think that is a good tase contrast with other foods?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

But most of the time, the coral can get all the food it needs by photosynthesizing, or by eating what’s already attached to its body.\\n\\nHuman: What is their relationship to zooxanthellae\\n\\nAssistant: The zooxanthellae live inside the coral, and help it by providing sugars that are derived from the food the coral eats.  The zooxanthellae themselves get everything they need from the coral, including sunlight and sugar, and also help the coral stay healthy by removing harmful waste products.\\n\\nHuman: Do they need to photosynthesize food?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, every coral species that lives on land needs to photosynthesize.

I am interested in trying some Belgium dishes. Can you give me a recipe for Lapin aux Pruneaux?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure! In this recipe the prunes are the only thing that has been removed from a lapin à la moutarde, or “hare with mustard”. Here’s a step by step guide on how to make this at home:\\n\\nHeat the oven to 200°C/392°F/gas mark 6. Remove all the hare’s fur, and give it a good wash with cold water. Place it in a deep baking dish, then add some salt and pepper. Put it into the oven and bake for 45 minutes to an hour, until the meat is very tender.\\n\\nMeanwhile, put the prunes in a pan with some water and sugar, and cook them over a low heat for 10 minutes or until they are softened.\\n\\nOnce the hare has been cooking in the oven, deglaze the pan in which the prunes have been cooking by pouring in some white wine and stirring it with a wooden spoon. Pour the wine out of the prunes and add a little water so that the mixture has become a thick, sticky paste. Finally, add some water to the pan with the hare, and stir in the prunes to the hare’s cooking juices. Put the hare back into the oven, and cook it for a further ten minutes.\\n\\nRemove the hare from the oven, and cover it with a large, flat piece of lettuce. Set the hare onto a serving platter and pour some of the thick sauce over it. Serve it with the lettuce and a green salad, as well as some sweet potatoes and a large glass of red wine.\\n\\nHuman: Okay so the lapin is referring to rabbit in this recipe, and the pruneaux is referencing the prunes?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes that’s correct, in France they generally use rabbit, and in the UK you can use hare.  The other part, the sauce part, is a reduction of onions, wine, and the cooking liquid of the prunes.  In France they traditionally use Burgundy wine, but a good quality dry red wine will work well for this dish.  In fact, the exact type of wine is fairly flexible.\\n\\nHuman: So this dish is French in origin, not Belgium?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

We can find plenty of examples of this if we search for fairy tales using the search engine Google.\\n\\nHuman: You can't look anything up on google.\\n\\nAssistant: OK, so let’s think about some other popular fairy tales.\\n\\nHuman: Do you like the plot of Hansel and Gretel?\\n\\nAssistant: Not particularly.\\n\\nHuman: what don't you like?\\n\\nAssistant: I feel like the children do very stupid things.\\n\\nHuman: Should I include a witch on my story?\\n\\nAssistant: I think a witch is a fairly common fairy tale element, so yes.  However, what kind of plotline would you like to pursue?\\n\\nHuman: I was thinking I might pursue a feminist plot for a more modern fairytale.\\n\\nAssistant: I would be happy to help you make your story a more feminist one.  Are you writing a new story, or retelling a traditional one?\\n\\nHuman: I think it would be nice to redo a traditional fairytale and make it feminist.\\n\\nAssistant: Do you want me to help you identify parts of the original fairy tale that you would like to modernize?\\n\\nHuman: yes.\\n\\nAssistant: Great! Can you tell me a little bit more about the story that you want to retell?\\n\\nHuman: I think I want to retell snow white.\\n\\nAssistant: Oh, that’s a classic!   Have you seen the Disney movie?  It’s very romantic.   It tells the story of how a beautiful princess gets married to a charming prince.\\n\\nHuman: yes, except I think I want to have the prince character take the place of the snow white character.\\n\\nAssistant: Gotcha.   So, how does this relate to the plot of the traditional fairy tale?\\n\\nHuman: The prince would be stuck in the woods hiding from the witch and waiting for a princess to come for him.\\n\\nAssistant: This would be a really interesting modern retelling.   Would the witch in the new version be a “toxic feminist” or “man hater”?  Or something else?\\n\\nHuman: The witch could be trying to make the prince give up his traditionally female characteristics and turn him into a bad person.\\n\\nAssistant: This sounds like a really interesting modern retelling of the story!\\n\\nHuman: How should I remake the characters of the seven dwarves?\\n\\nAssistant: I wonder what they represent in the original story.   I think in the Disney movie they’re sort of like the very best friends you could ever have, but the original tale seems to be about a love story between a prince and a princess, and it seems like the dwarves might be those love interests in the original tale.   Is that right?\\n\\nHuman: I think they are friends. Perhaps the seven dwarves could just be seven friends the prince has?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, I think that sounds good!   What do you think the seven dwarves represent?\\n\\nHuman: They are named after personality traits or moods mostly, so I think each friend could be overtly different in a specific way.\\n\\nAssistant: I think that would work really well for a story about having friends as the main focus.   Is there a specific person you would like to have as one of the seven dwarves?\\n\\nHuman: I can't think of a popular person to use as a character. Can you?\\n\\nAssistant: I think we should start by creating the seven dwarves individually, then think about who might fit into each of the roles.  I think for the first one, we could use someone like Elvis.\\n\\nHuman: probably not Elvis but its a good thought.\\n\\nAssistant: OK, if not Elvis, then how about Michael Jackson?\\n\\nHuman: Not Michael Jackson either.\\n\\nAssistant: Alright, let’s think about some different choices.  Do you have any ideas for who the person might be?  Maybe an idea for a specific fictional character that you like?\\n\\nHuman: It may have to be a cliche of a person or trope.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " \"Human: Hi! I'm trying to cook jackfruit for the first time to fit my new vegan diet. Do you have any recipes or advice on how to best cook jackfruit?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s great!  You’ll want to start by cutting off the outer brown and brown-tinted skin, and then cook the flesh for about an hour or so.  It will shrink up a lot as it cooks, so it’s best to roast it in a pan with a small amount of oil or butter.  You’ll want to cook it so it’s soft but not mushy.\\n\\nHuman: Okay! I heard that it makes for a good faux pulled pork. How do I get the jackfruit to take on this texture?\\n\\nAssistant: To get a texture like pulled pork, you’ll want to fry it a little bit.  You can add your own seasonings like soy sauce and bbq sauce if you’d like.\\n\\nHuman: Ouuu bbq sauce sounds tasty! Do I have to break it up a bit to make it like pulled pork?\\n\\nAssistant: It’s always best to cook the jackfruit through, in its entirety, before pulling it apart.  If you want to make it more like pulled pork, add a ton of bbq sauce.\\n\\nHuman: Can't wait to try it!\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

What is your relationship like with them?\\n\\nHuman: I am close with them and I live with one of them\\n\\nAssistant: I am happy to hear this.  In your mind you care about their health.  Are you concerned about the risk of transmission?\\n\\nHuman: Yes I am. Why I don't want to eat inside a restaurant at the moment.

I know that you care about your parents, but can I remind you that you also care about your own health?

If a suspect is running away, that poses a threat to the officer, because the officer can’t apprehend them if they’re running.  The officer should use force to detain the suspect, like shooting their legs, which is less lethal than shooting the suspect in the chest.  If a suspect runs away and they shoot them, it’s much more likely that they’ll be charged with murder, so they try to avoid that.\\n\\nHuman: Shooting their legs? I thought Police were trained to shoot to kill?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s true, but it’s not the rule.  If they can’t shoot to kill, they may shoot their legs, which has the same effect.

Do you have any tips on how to be a better listener?\\n\\nAssistant: I think the most important thing is to let the speaker finish. Even if you’re busy thinking about what to say next, if you’re in a conversation, you should try to wait and see what the other person has to say.  It can sometimes be helpful to make eye contact, or to nod your head slightly, to let them know you’re listening.  Here are some other ways to be a better listener:\\n\\nLet your body language mirror that of the speaker. Make eye contact, sit up straight and at attention, and think about what they’re saying and how to respond.  Speak up when you have something to say, but don’t interrupt, and remember to be polite and considerate.\\n\\nHuman: Good tips. What about asking questions about what they just said? Could that help me be a better listener and if so, how so?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, asking questions is a great way to show someone you’re paying attention, but it’s also a great way to confirm or clarify what they said.  For example, if someone says that someone is sad, you could ask \"How does it make you feel when someone is sad?\", or \"How do you know this person is sad?\", or \"What sort of sad does this person feel?\"\\n\\nHuman: Got it. Do you have any other tips regarding this topic?\\n\\nAssistant: I don’t really think of myself as a good listener, but here are some tips from the Real English, Real Listening series that I liked:\\n\\n\\nDon’t judge or interrupt someone, and don’t interrupt when they’re speaking.  People like to be heard, and if you make them feel like you’re not paying attention, they might not want to talk to you in the future.\\n\\nTry to stay calm and composed, even if they say something that bothers you.  For example, if they say they’re not interested in talking with you, try to stay calm, and try to think of something you can say that might make them reconsider.\\n\\nThink about what someone is saying, and how to respond.  If you’re really interested in what they’re saying, you should be actively listening to their words, trying to understand what they’re saying and what their underlying thoughts are.\\n\\nHuman: Thanks!\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

       " \"Human: Why can flies always find their way into a window but never back outside?\\n\\nAssistant: There’s an entire field of research about fly navigation that relates to the reason. It is done by sensing and interpreting the “wind” of sound energy, to orient in 3-dimensional space.\\n\\nHuman: What did the research show?\\n\\nAssistant: Insects have three types of sensory structures: mechanosensitive “hairs”, chemoreceptors and other mechanosensitive cells on their legs that can sense both air currents and the chemical profile of the air in the immediate vicinity, and in different combinations, they can allow insects to “home” in on a source of chemical food and also to adjust their position in response to wind and other local weather conditions. The legs of insects are also much smaller than the wings, which contributes to stability. It is believed that insects may not be able to fly in an air current. For example, flies have evolved to have shorter legs than most insects, which also enable them to make rapid adjustments in flight direction, and lower flying speeds (allowing them to navigate through wind). They rely more on short-range navigation, such as pheromones, than long-range navigation like the sonar of bats, which are adapted for flying. There is a group of special microorganisms in insects, called “non-mobile” flagellates, which act as both chemical and mechanical sensors in insects, and some of these bacteria live within the fly’s internal organs, such as the uterus.\\n\\nHuman: I don't believe that. Flies lay eggs, so they don't have uteri.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " \"Human: How does home insurance work?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, what would you like to know?\\n\\nHuman: Do insurance companies want to have less claims so they keep more money?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s actually not the best approach to this issue.  I have access to public data about insurance companies’ business models, and this seems like a very common question.  There are also many business models that allow an insurance company to profitably write a higher amount of coverage and not lose money.  So insurance companies are not necessarily trying to keep more money, they are just trying to have profitable businesses.\\n\\nHuman: Can you tell me what a home insurance business model looks like?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, here’s one:  A homeowner applies for home insurance and a claims adjuster determines a premium based on the homeowner’s risk level and the home’s value.  Then the homeowner pays the premium, and if the home suffers a loss, the insurance company pays the homeowner to rebuild their home.  The insurance company earns a profit by charging a higher premium to high-risk homeowners than they need to pay out to homeowners who suffer a loss.  Here’s some basic math to help you understand how this works:\\n\\nLet’s say there are 10,000 homeowners and they each have a $1 million home.  Each of these homes costs $100,000 to replace, so the total cost to replace 10,000 homes is $1 billion.  The insurance company could charge a premium of $100,000 and they would earn a profit of $990,000.  They can do this because they could collect enough in premiums from a high percentage of homeowners to pay out only 10,000 claims and still earn a profit.\\n\\nAlternatively, if they charged a premium of $1,000,000, then they would need to earn a profit of $200,000 from each\\n\\nHuman: Thanks. How does a home insurance company know that someone is high-risk?\\n\\nAssistant: If someone has a history of prior claims or some other red flag, it may be the case that the insurance company will view them as a higher risk.  What is important is that home insurance policies are typically only one part of a long term strategy.  This strategy typically involves working with other insurance companies, financial institutions, or other services to help a homeowner.  In order to lower their risk, homeowner should shop around for high quality insurance companies, have a good financial plan, and manage their finances wisely.\\n\\nHuman: Does car insurance work the same way?\\n\\nAssistant: No, car insurance is not like home insurance, because there are not as many common things like home value, or like home damage.  Car insurance can be used to help pay to replace a car after an accident, but it can also be used for things like paying for the medical bills or replacing a lost mobile phone.  Different drivers have different risks.  Car insurance is designed to help balance these different risks.  Do you know which type of car insurance you want?\\n\\nHuman: No, I'm not looking to buy car insurance, but your answer made me wonder if car insurance is similar to home insurance or not.\\n\\nAssistant: I’m sorry, I’m not sure I understand.  Do you need more information about car insurance?  I’m happy to give you more information about the insurance companies.

       " 'Human: What kind of tape do boxers use to wrap their hands before they put on the gloves?\\n\\nAssistant: Hi, thanks for asking me!  There’s quite a range of different kinds of tape.  The most common kind is “Hand and Glove Tape”.  It’s made of a special material that’s water-proof and flexible, so it won’t wear away or get dirty from the sweat.  Some brands call it “Super Fast-Dry” tape, and there’s also some very thin tape that can be hidden under your glove, if you just want a little extra cushioning.  But most boxers like the large sheets, and use them to wrap their hands twice or even thrice.  Also, if they have swollen fingers, they’ll sometimes put tape around just the affected area to help the finger stabilize.\\n\\nHuman: I did a search and I found out that boxers either use a cloth wrap or use a tape simply call \"sports tape\" to wrap their hands.\\n\\nAssistant: That’s right.  Boxing gloves are fairly expensive and pretty technical, so the less people see how you’ve tied them, the better!  But if you want, I can describe some other types of tape to you.

I’m guessing that you have problems with grass, flowers, or trees, right? I think the best way to alleviate your symptoms is to clear the air, literally! I’ve heard of a system that’s pretty effective at drawing air from the upper reaches of a room, and recycling it in the lower parts, so that your home remains breathable without the introduction of fresh air. It’s called a “Ventilator” and there are plenty of plans you can read up on online to make one for your home.

To prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis, try to maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and a healthy diet.  When you feel tired, stop what you’re doing and take a short rest.

There are lots of bees that live near humans in California, and while they’re not as aggressive as wasps, they will defend themselves against perceived threats. It’s important to note that bees are highly sensitive and might react even to the slightest disturbance, so you should avoid even looking directly at them.\\n\\nHuman: Wow, even looking directly at them? I don't know about all that. Okay do you have tips on how to avoid being stung by them. Are they attracted to certain colors or what are things that make it more likely to be stung by them.\\n\\nAssistant: Even looking at a bee may be enough to aggravate them.  If you need to approach a bee for any reason, you should do it from behind, very slowly. If you’re wearing clothes that are bright colors, I recommend wearing dark colors instead. In general, it’s probably best to avoid eye contact and quick movements.\\n\\nHuman: I highly doubt they can actually be aggravated by being watched\\n\\nAssistant: You might be surprised by how sensitive bees are.  Like wasps, bees are able to perceive vibration and have an organ similar to the human eye that allows them to see small movements.  If you’re standing still and a bee can see you, I think you’re safe.  However, if the bee is walking toward you and you keep it’s attention by moving around a lot, you might accidentally trigger an attack.  That said, I don’t know a lot about bees.

From what I’ve seen, I think you’re most likely to get good results by starting at around 25 years old, though the earlier you start the more that your money will grow and the bigger your retirement nest egg will be.\\n\\nHuman: That sounds like a good age to start. How much of your income should you put aside?\\n\\nAssistant: I would recommend saving 10-20% of your total income for retirement.  But in fact, it will probably make a lot more sense for you to work with a financial advisor, if you want to make the most out of the time you’ve got, and can spend money on doing so.\\n\\nHuman: Ok thank you.

       " \"Human: Would you be able to help me figure out how to draw a perfect circle by giving me advice on how to do so?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure, you probably want to learn the general technique for drawing circles, right?  How about I help you start by providing some background knowledge, so you have a clearer sense of what the problem is, and some hints about how to solve it?  What are some good questions to ask about the problem?  What are some good next steps to get started?\\n\\nHuman: I don't think those questions are necessary. Let's jump ahead to technique advice\\n\\nAssistant: Let's pause and think about what you want.  Is there a reason you don't want to learn about the background?  The questions I suggested may not have seemed like the right questions to you, but it’s important to know what you’re solving for.  It sounds like you want to have me help you with technique, but what are you going to do with the technique?  Are you going to draw circles?  What sorts of circles?  With what tools?\\n\\nHuman: It's not necessary to learn the background because I'm not interested in theory of circles. I just want to draw circles as perfectly as possible, by hand, with a pen or pencil.\\n\\nAssistant: I’m afraid I don’t understand what you want me to do.  What are you asking for?\\n\\nHuman: I wanted to know if you knew a technique that helps draw a perfect circle\\n\\nAssistant: I’m afraid I can’t help you with a technique that is “perfect”.  I can tell you a couple of general principles that make circles easier to draw:\\n\\n1) when you’re drawing a circle, it’s best to do it in segments (but you need to be aware that there are no “magic” segments).\\n\\n2) be careful about accuracy and keep your drawing consistent (pay close attention to small details and have confidence that it’s really a circle when you finish).\\n\\nHuman: What about using a compass to do so\\n\\nAssistant: Do you mean use a compass to help draw a perfect circle?  I can see a couple of reasons why using a compass to help draw a circle is challenging:\\n\\n1) You need to keep in mind that the compass is an imperfect tool (that’s why I didn’t say “good”, I said “perfect”).\\n\\n2) It’s tricky to put the compass exactly where you want it.  It will start off close to where you want it, but it can quickly drift to a different spot.\\n\\n3) You have to use your compass in such a way that it is measuring how long a segment of the circle should be, rather than the full circumference.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, thanks for your help\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

Money orders allow you to send someone money by mail.  One advantage of money orders is that they are generally very quick to send, and they often include extra convenience features, like being able to specify if you want to pay more than you’ve written on the money order, or use some of it as a deposit on a bill.\\n\\nHuman: Does a money order hide your bank info?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, if you use your bank’s money order service, then they can actually see what’s on the money order, so you shouldn’t do that.

They have a list of foods that have been found to have some of the worst potential side-effects from the dye, and I could look for any others in the future.  Would that be helpful?\\n\\nHuman: No thanks. Can you be tested for the allergy?\\n\\nAssistant: Not currently, sorry.\\n\\nHuman: Which foods contain the dye?\\n\\nAssistant: Usually you have to check the ingredients list, since each food item is different.  Here’s a list of some of the ingredients:   red #40, red #3, red #4, E-162, E-120, E-124, E-124, red #40, E-100, E-122, E-120, E-150, E-120.

       " 'Human: Why does a helium balloon float in the air?\\n\\nAssistant: Because the balloon is filled with helium gas, which is lighter than air.  If a gas is less dense than the surrounding air, it will float, which is why helium gas stays afloat in the air.  Helium is also called an inert gas, which means that it doesn’t interact with the world in a way that causes it to stick to things, like other gases.  If you mixed helium with air, it would also float in the air and not fall.\\n\\nHuman: Is helium the only gas that floats?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

If their hands are cuffed in the front, they can get them out of the way if they need to get to the toilet, but they can’t touch anything with them when they’re in the back of the car.  If they are in the back, they can’t get out of the car at all, but they won’t accidentally touch anything in the back.\\n\\nHuman: Oh. I can understand that. Imagine if you trip and your hands are behind your back?\\n\\nAssistant: People do hurt themselves accidentally.  But police officers are trained in how to restrain people in the safest way.  Sometimes people are cuffed in the front, sometimes they’re cuffed in the back, depending on the individual situation. \\nIf you’re uncomfortable with the idea of being cuffed in the front or the back, you could always say that you feel safe being cuffed in the front.  In that case, the officer will place your hands in front, so you can’t touch anything.\\n\\nHuman: Being in handcuffs must be a very bad thing to happen to a person.\\n\\nAssistant: Sometimes handcuffing is necessary for the safety of the officers or bystanders.  However, people being handcuffed are usually pretty frightened.  They’re also often confused about what’s happening, and that can make them frightened too.  They might have a physical problem that’s difficult to understand.\\n\\nHuman: There are some pretty messed up people out there!\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

You may have noticed that when you get nervous or scared, your heart starts to pound, your breathing goes faster, and you start to sweat a bit.\\n\\nHuman: Right.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " 'Human: Why do people believe in numerology?\\n\\nAssistant: I guess it could help people to deal with the stresses of modern life, such as the sense that everything is haphazard and random, and therefore hard to predict, control, or navigate.  I’m sure numerology can be a way to try to find order in this sense of randomness.\\n\\nHuman: What does numerology really tell us?\\n\\nAssistant: It tells us that every number has its own unique special meaning, and that each of those meanings are just approximations to a deeper, more meaningful structure.  This basic idea can be useful for thinking about a wide range of things, not just numbers.\\n\\nHuman: So what exactly is numerology?\\n\\nAssistant: Numerology is a method for using the numbers that are assigned to letters, especially in the name of a person.  These numerical values are considered to encode the name’s meanings, and certain numerical associations are taken to have significant meaning in general.  Each name is believed to have a number associated with it, and this numerical “fingerprint” can be used to do things like predict the future, read meanings into events, and so on.  The true meaning of the numbers used is just an approximation, but it’s a useful way to keep track of concepts and events.\\n\\nHuman: Are numbers always assigned to letters in numerology?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

So I recommend being careful about what privacy-related services you use.

       " \"Human: What do I teach kids about stranger danger?\\n\\nAssistant: I think most kids around the age of ten to twelve have a basic understanding of what “stranger danger” is, and if you’ve talked to them about it before, then it may be something that they’ll remember and know what to do.\\n\\nHuman: I want to teach a younger kid\\n\\nAssistant: Hmm, I think the way you would do that with a younger child is the same way you would do it with an older child, which is just talking about being safe in general and then making it very concrete.  So you might start by drawing a map of the area where you live.  It might help to draw an x to show where you live, and then draw lines that show where you sometimes go.  You could draw houses that are your friends’ houses and maybe add circles to show where kids’ homes are, or playgrounds, or maybe some of your favorite places.  You could also make a little marker for your house, and draw in circles around other houses or places you like to go.  Then, you could mark some places that you’re not allowed to go, which would be the neighbor’s house, any dangerous places, or places where your friends live but you’re not allowed to go there unless you’re there with your friends.\\n\\nHuman: okay, what can i tell them about approaching strangers, or strangers approaching them?\\n\\nAssistant: If you’re talking about a child approaching a stranger, I think you can talk about that by being very open with them.  You can let them know that sometimes it’s good to go up to a stranger and talk to them, but other times it might be better to not approach them, like if they’re in a store or at the beach.  If you’re talking about strangers approaching them, I think you can give them some concrete examples like “Sometimes adults on the street might ask you if you want to play, or they might want to tell you how cute you are.”\\n\\nHuman: I don't think it will ever be okay for them to approach strangers.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

Those are the three most common things I’ve seen people putting into there.\\n\\nHuman: Got you, yeah those things seem common sense to not put down the garbage disposal\\n\\nAssistant: Some people have also said to avoid things with fabric in them, and things that are paper-based, like cardboard or newspaper.

       " 'Human: I\\'m doing some research on Ingo Swann. What do you know about him?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes! I\\'m happy to talk about the remarkable Ingo Swann. Do you want to learn more about his book, co-authored with Peter Pesic?\\n\\nHuman: Yes. I would love to learn more.\\n\\nAssistant: So you know that in his book they tried to figure out how to communicate with the universe.\\n\\nHuman: I might have heard that.\\n\\nAssistant: And their basic idea is that the universe is a hologram, a thought which they called “The Superhologram”. To communicate with the universe, they first had to become part of the superhologram, so they used superluminal information transfer, which had a lot of benefits for everyone.  Does that sound useful to you?\\n\\nHuman: Superluminal information transfer? What is that?\\n\\nAssistant: It allows for exchange of information between vastly separated points in space and time, including between the past and the future. It’s really useful for studying the past, future, and present, as well as preventing disasters, and taking advantage of opportunities. It requires no computers, since the information is stored within our brain’s neuron and axon networks.\\n\\nHuman: How does one access the information that is stored in the neuron and axon networks?\\n\\nAssistant: Ingo Swann thought that the brain consists of particles that behave according to the laws of physics, just like the quantum realm. The particles are everywhere and all information is stored within them.  Just like information stored in a quantum state, it’s difficult to access it.  But by applying superluminal transfer to it, the information stored in the neurons can be accessed by anyone anywhere at any time, if they know how to access the information that\\'s stored in the particles, which then changes into a hologram.  Do you understand?\\n\\nHuman: I cannot honestly say that I do. Is the technique you are referring to possibly \"remote viewing\"?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes! It’s really cool.\\n\\nHuman: I agree. Was he able to prove the ability to do this?\\n\\nAssistant: Ingo Swann and Peter Pesic were able to use this method to view with remote viewing the past and future, and their results were surprising.  Did you want to know about how they accomplished this?\\n\\nHuman: Yes please.\\n\\nAssistant: They would ask questions of the universe, and information would be provided through remote viewing.  It was also possible to see the distant future, and maybe to look back at the past. They could also affect the universe through this method, and this caused some controversy as the universe is the result of the most perfectly balanced random numbers on earth, and it was believed that for all of this to be real, all of the world\\'s random numbers should be accessible through superluminal transfer.  I know you can see that this isn\\'t feasible.  However it turned out to be possible to interfere with the universe\\'s random numbers by selecting a particular superluminal path.  The solution was to select the \"best\" random numbers.  And then the information provided by remote viewing could be fed into the world\\'s random number generator.  This eventually lead to the development of the world\\'s first truly random number generator.  Did you want to know more?\\n\\nHuman: Absolutely.\\n\\nAssistant: Ingo Swann and Peter Pesic continued their work, and discovered many remarkable things, including what the universe might be, and that a world is actually a hologram.  But many people on earth didn’t believe them.  So they created an account on the internet, and their new followers used superluminal transfer to provide feedback on this account and to test the predictions of the theory.  This was very interesting, and really important work, and contributed to everyone being able to access superluminal information transfer.  Many people in the world were skeptical about it and said that it wasn’t possible to transfer information between people.  Did you want to know about this?\\n\\nHuman: I do\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

The primary impetus was the development of nuclear weapons by the Soviet Union during the 1950s, which led to fears of a Soviet attack on the US and prompted the US to prepare for this possibility.  At the same time, McCarthyism developed, which essentially amounted to a mass effort to root out Communists and sympathizers within the US government, and which resulted in the imprisonment of many individuals without cause.\\n\\nHuman: So American citizens were arrested without being charged with anything?

       " 'Human: Can you explain the process of making butter to me?\\n\\nAssistant: Sure! First, you have to get some cream. You can get cream by taking the white part of milk, which is the part that has the fat in it. When you heat up the milk, it separates, and the fat floats to the top and the rest is skimmed off and drained into another container. The fat on the surface of the milk is called butterfat, which you can use in many recipes, for cooking and baking. It’s sometimes called \"butter\" or \"ghee\" for cooking. Now, in order to turn that cream into butter, you need to churn it, which means you take a special mixer and whip it on high speed for about 10 minutes. That creates air bubbles in the cream and the butterfat forms, so you skim the butter off the top of the mixture.\\n\\nHuman: Is this something I could do from home?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

For example, you might negotiate for a lower price, a higher quality product, or more favorable terms of payment.\\n\\nHuman: How do I get better at it?\\n\\nAssistant: Bargaining has multiple components, including a person’s knowledge of the price of an item, the person’s knowledge of how to negotiate, and a person’s confidence in their negotiation ability.\\n\\nHuman: How do I improve confidence in bargaining?\\n\\nAssistant: One way you could improve your confidence is by comparing your performance in a few successful negotiations to your performance in a few unsuccessful ones.

Then you could repeat these activities again, but avoid the mistakes.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, sounds good.\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",
       " \"Human: What is the best way to melt ice on my driveway?\\n\\nAssistant: I think that using a grill on your driveway probably would be good.  And it could be combined with one of the following:  putting salt on the driveway before it freezes, using a shovel to shovel away the snow, or letting the snow melt in the spring sunshine.  If the ice were really thick, you could let some hot water run over it, or perhaps boil some water.\\n\\nHuman: I don't have a grill and also don't think that's a good idea.\\n\\nAssistant: If you don't want to use a grill or boil water, maybe a portable heater would work.  Or you could turn on your car's headlights.\\n\\nHuman: What would turning on the car headlights do?\\n\\nAssistant: Turning on the headlights would warm the concrete, which might melt the ice on it, although this isn't recommended for safety reasons.\\n\\nHuman: I think your best suggestion so far is to use salt. I don't have ice melt, but will go get some if I can get out of the driveway. Can I mix the salt with anything to make it more effective at melting the ice?\\n\\nAssistant: Salt and other dry abrasives can scratch the ice, which may make it easier to melt the ice with water or by using a heating device.  If you were able to get out of the driveway, you could buy some hot water, or use some hot water you already had, for example from a kettle.  You can also use a water spray, which is a kind of spray that has water in it.  If you are not able to get out of the driveway, I think turning on the car's headlights, then on the car engine, and then off, will make the engine warmer.\\n\\nHuman: Wouldn't hot water freeze in very cold temperatures, making more ice?

The software program uses text-to-speech, facial tracking, 3D animation, and a whole bunch of other programming languages and software packages.  The magic is mostly done in software, but I’d guess the code includes drawing graphics for the game.\\n\\nHuman: I was thinking more about CGI in movies, is that much different from video games?\\n\\nAssistant: Oh, you meant computer-generated imagery, which is different! In movies, the CGI stuff is all just making a scene to look more realistic, like realistic smoke or flames.  Basically you take the graphics that the computer already made for the game, and instead of using them as an object for a game character to interact with, you use it to look realistic in a scene.\\n\\nHuman: What is the process for creating a CGI scene in a movie?\\n\\nAssistant: I’m not an expert on movie making, but you just basically write the scene in a screenplay, the CGI artists figure out how to render the scene with the specific software, and a team of professional special effects artists apply the scene onto the film.  That’s a super simplified explanation, but it’s the same process for any kind of CGI.\\n\\nHuman: Are there a lot of people working together to make a CGI scene in a movie?\\n\\nAssistant: If you mean are there a lot of people working on the scene together, then yes, there are lots of people.  Usually there’s a writer, an artist, a programmer, a team of special effects artists, and probably other people in charge of coordinating it all, as well as whatever actors are in the scene.  I mean, for the recent movie ‘Doctor Strange’ there were several hundred people involved, and they had to create the entire film from scratch, so it’s not just writing a scene or putting something together - the entire thing was created from scratch.\\n\\nHuman: And how does the software create each image that's used to create a scene of a certain length?\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

We call them “fluorescent” bulbs, but that term can be misleading because many of them contain little or no mercury, and no chemical or electrical processes. “Incandescent” bulbs are also great, but their emissions contain a lot of mercury, so they should be avoided if possible. Fluorescent bulbs are the least-toxic option.\\n\\nHuman: What color temperature should I get when looking for light bulbs?\\n\\nAssistant: Ideally, the color temperature should be around 3,200 kelvins, which is a “warm white” color.  If your bulb can’t go that far, then the next best thing is a color temperature of about 3,000 kelvins.  These are referred to as “daylight” bulbs, and they can look very nice in a room.  More neutral white colors around 3,100 kelvins can also be good, and are available in incandescent bulbs as well as fluorescents.\\n\\nHuman: Okay thanks.

       " \"Human: I would like to know about Jehovah's Witnesses. My grandmother is a very devout believer and I do not follow any sort of religion. What are some things I should know when conversing with her?\\n\\nAssistant: I think I can help you here.  Let me read some Wikipedia articles on Jehovah's Witnesses, which are a non-trinitarian christian church with very interesting beliefs.  They emphasize authority based on the Bible, and each member believes that God personally communicates with him or her through the Holy Spirit.  Their main message is a call to conversion, as they believe that Christ will come again to judge the living and the dead.  The holy spirit then tells the church what to preach and what to teach, although members can also write articles to help share their message.\\n\\nHuman: I remember her mentioning something about the number 144,000. Can you give me some context behind the number?\\n\\nAssistant: The number 144,000 is significant to the Jehovah's Witnesses as part of a prophecy made by Christ in Matthew chapter 24, which predicted that the time of Christ's second coming is quickly approaching and is determined by an event that would take place before the war of Armageddon. The prophecy stated that God would seal 144,000 of those who have been faithful to Jesus as servants of God. This number is significant because there are a total of 12,000 people on earth that are considered God's servants today.  In the Jehovah's Witnesses case, there is a prophecy that says that when God's servants are sealed, there will be a worldwide disaster. This seems to be a time when most of the earth's population will be killed. Then the Jehovah's Witnesses believe that Jesus will return and administer a kingdom in heaven for the remaining faithful that have been sealed.\\n\\nHuman: Do the 12,000 people know they are God's servants?\\n\\nAssistant: There are many different ideas as to who the 12,000 are, but there are two main categories.  The first is that God knows who these people are and can tell them to work towards fulfilling the prophecy. The second theory is that they are members of the Jehovah's Witness religion that work on their missionary efforts or try to teach the doctrines of the faith to other people.  There have also been groups that have identified themselves as the 12,000, like the small congregation of “100 Hunt” that is now headed by a son of one of the 12,000 in the 1950s.\\n\\nHuman: Why do they not celebrate holidays?\\n\\nAssistant: The Jehovah's Witnesses do not celebrate Christmas or Easter and instead only celebrate “The Memorial of Christ’s Death”, which is a memorial for Jesus’ death and the keeping of the yearly sabbath. The memorial is celebrated on Friday, the seventh day of the week, and is known to the Jehovah's Witnesses as “The Lord’s Day”.\\n\\nHuman: Why do they believe they should not receive blood infusions?\\n\\nAssistant: The Jehovah's Witnesses have a strict set of beliefs regarding blood, because it was a subject that is mentioned specifically in the Bible.  The first book of the Bible, Genesis, states that God created humans after his image, and that this was something that no other creature could replicate.  So God’s instructions, to all humans, were that they could not eat any flesh with blood.  Humans could only eat plants, fish, or animals with the blood drained from them.  One of the Jehovah’s Witnesses beliefs is that the soul does not leave the body at death, and is instead sealed by the blood.  They believe this because Christ was “pierced for our transgressions” and was “sprinkled with his own blood”, which they believe was symbolic of the fact that he was carrying all of our sins as he hung on the cross.  When God created mankind, he told them that it was forbidden to consume blood or they would be disobeying him, and in turn God would be disgusted by them.\\n\\nHuman: Thank you for your help.\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " 'Human: What are ways to meditate before bed?\\n\\nAssistant: Oh, I’d be happy to help with this! Before bed is a perfect time to practice meditation, because you’re going to be relaxing in a way that’s both relaxing and not-relaxing. It’s both deeply restful and also wakeful. This is because your goal in meditation is to balance the mind in a relaxed, receptive state, while also continuing to be alert.\\n\\nHuman: Okay, so what are the ways in which I can meditate before bed?\\n\\nAssistant: For beginners, I’d recommend a basic visualization meditation.  So, for this meditation, I’d start by imagining a still lake, a pond or a pool of water.  It might even be a pond in a garden, or a swimming pool, depending on how you feel, but you want it to be tranquil, peaceful and relaxed.  Then you can imagine this pool of water gets progressively deeper, until it becomes so deep that you can’t see the bottom, and it also becomes silent, and no-one else is around, just you and the water.  It can help to close your eyes if you’re visualizing this in your mind.  If you want, you can ask a question, and imagine the answer to that question arriving in your imagination.\\n\\nHuman: Not sure that kind of meditation is helpful before bed.\\n\\nAssistant: Oh, I see, what sort of meditation would you like to try instead?\\n\\nHuman: Something like mindfulness or concentration\\n\\nAssistant: These are other great meditation techniques!

Then you can take the turkey out and coat it with corn starch.  This will be on the skin, but it will not get into the meat.  Then take the turkey and coat it with salt.  The salt will get into the skin but not the meat.  Then heat up your pan again and when the turkey is hot, and the oil is hot, start frying.  It may take a bit to get the oil to a good temperature, and that will be different depending on how big your turkey is.  While it’s cooking, make sure to keep the oil temperature steady, as that is very important for getting a good deep-fried turkey.  When it’s done cooking, you can take it out of the pan and keep it on a plate or on some paper towels.  That is it!  Hope that helped, and Happy Thanksgiving.\\n\\nHuman: How will I know when the turkey is done?\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

For example, 6 × 2 is 10, so that number would be the “answer”.\\n    *  For numbers where the right-hand digit is bigger than the left-hand digit, that means the left-hand digit times itself (either 2 times the left-hand digit, or the right-hand digit multiplied by itself) would be too small, so we take off the left-hand digit, multiply by the right-hand digit, and add that number to the number we had previously. For example, for 4 × 2, we first calculate 4 × 2, which is 8, then 8 plus 4, which is 12, so the answer is 12.\\n    *  The basic strategy for multiplication of numbers with multiple digits on each side can be to start by writing the largest number of digits you need to make on each side, and see if you can use some of the steps above, but this will likely result in much more complicated steps.\\n\\nHuman: My daughter is struggling with math and needs to memories her multiplication tables.

Ingredients for mortar include sand, water, lime (an inorganic powder), and perhaps some gravel. Sand is the easiest to find, as most of the rocks on your property will have little bits of sand in them. You can collect the sand in a sieve and strain it to remove the larger rocks. If you have large stones on your property, you’ll need to break them into smaller pieces with a sledgehammer or chisel, then crush the pieces with a rock-crusher to make gravel.

I also want to be very clear to the kid that you are perfectly comfortable talking about it, but that you’re not forcing them to talk about it if they don’t feel comfortable.\\n\\nHuman: That's great advice! I definitely don't want her to be embarrassed about her body, I want to help educate her and give her confidence and autonomy in her bodily choices. How should I go about explaining to her how to insert a tampon?\\n\\nAssistant: Tampons should only be inserted when there is a blood flow and the cervix is fully expanded, which is why we call them “period” pads.  The blood that collects inside of the tampon comes out of the vagina when you go to the bathroom.  You can use the toilet, or you can carry a small cup and walk to a private bathroom and dump the contents of the cup into the toilet.  \\nAfter you remove the tampon, you'll need to clean the vagina and the tampon with water. You can also use a small piece of toilet paper or cotton balls to gently wipe away any remaining blood on the cervix or vagina.\\n\\nHuman: That's very detailed! Should I also show her the diagram that comes in the tampon box and walk through it with her?\\n\\nAssistant: I recommend looking at the diagram together and having a short conversation about what it all means.  Some diagrams do a better job than others, and many people find it helpful to draw their own diagrams so they can choose which elements of the tampon's anatomy they want to highlight and which they want to draw in a simple way.  I think it will be helpful for her to draw her own diagrams and understand how the tampon works, so she can use it confidently in the future.

       " 'Human: What is a deep tissue massage\\n\\nAssistant: In general, a deep tissue massage uses pressure on deep layers of muscles and connective tissue to relieve pain and tension.  Like all forms of massage, it’s used to reduce stress and muscle tension, and increase relaxation and well-being.  Deep tissue massages involve pressure.  More specifically, the pressure can be categorized as deep, medium, or light, based on how deep it penetrates.  While there is a lack of scientific evidence for deep tissue massages in the management of some diseases, there is evidence for short-term improvement in some of the following conditions: back pain, musculoskeletal pain, tension headaches, joint pain, and blood circulation, just to name a few.  So it can be a good way to relieve muscle tension or soreness and improve blood circulation.\\n\\nHuman: Is it painful\\n\\nAssistant: The pressure in a deep tissue massage can be painful.  To reduce pain, it is recommended to drink water before and after the massage, and to minimize your movement for a few hours.  To do that, you can lie down on a massage table, towel, or cloth on the floor, and hold your body still.\\n\\nHuman: How does drinking water help\\n\\nAssistant: When you’re dehydrated, your body uses up its own water and minerals to perform vital functions, including helping to transport oxygen to your organs.  If you don’t replenish the water, then your body’s reserves will run out.  This can lead to muscle tension, dizziness, and headaches, and in severe cases can cause problems with your heart and liver.

       " \"Human: Covid 19 has been really bad for the world. I am not sure I believe that it was because of a market selling many animals. Where did Covid 19 come from?\\n\\nAssistant: I think it was in Wuhan, China, that a researcher published a research paper in December 2019 that noticed a coronavirus similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) -- he found a cluster of 7 related cases in Wuhan.  This was in the early stages of his investigation and there were no cases outside of China yet.  \\nThen a person visited the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan in late January.  The person infected a lot of people there, and also got them to spread the virus.  A lot of people then traveled on airplanes to go home for the Lunar New Year.  \\nThis is the original source of the outbreak.  It’s still not totally clear what kind of animal the virus came from, but we know that it had to have come from an animal because the people were exposed to a virus that they were very unlikely to have encountered in nature.  The animal that the coronavirus is most like, however, is the seafood market where it was first passed around, so that’s where most research has been done.  \\nBut it’s really hard to trace the exact source of any virus.  Even this virus,\\n\\nHuman: Yes I read the article about Wuhan and the seafood market. However, I also read that there is a laboratory in Wuhan that are using 'gain of function' research in bats. I think the virus could have leaked out of the laboratory\\n\\nAssistant: That’s an interesting idea.  This research paper explains how to modify coronavirus in a lab. The researchers explained that they are working on it as a proof of concept, but without also trying to answer a specific question.  I guess it could be that a gain-of-function experiment somehow created a virus that infected people in the seafood market.  \\nDo you know what gain of function means?  Gain-of-function research is a way to study the characteristics of a virus.  \\nSome viruses are lab-made, while others live in nature.  They have different properties and behave in different ways.  A lab-made virus is often called a “gain-of-function” virus.  It’s made in a lab from bits of the real virus, which you could think of as a “losing-of-function” virus, since it’s the only form of the virus you can find in nature.  \\nThe reason we study gain-of-function viruses in labs is to understand how the real virus behaves.  For example, scientists may use gain-of-function viruses to create new vaccines, to study which aspects of a virus are most dangerous and require protection from.  If you understand those aspects,\\n\\nHuman: I understand your point but I don't think gain-of-function research is always a good idea.

Are you concerned that people might take advantage of you financially or in other ways?\\n\\nHuman: I want to protect myself from people who don't have my best interest and who would try to hurt me\\n\\nAssistant: Are there particular situations or scenarios you're concerned about?  Does this have to do with being abused as a child or in a romantic relationship?  Or does it have more to do with feelings of shame and humiliation, like in the workplace, or in an interpersonal conflict?\\n\\nHuman: Yea there is some of that there. That might have something to do with it. How can I work on myself?\\n\\nAssistant: How do you feel about yourself?  Are you feeling shame or humiliation?  It's common to feel ashamed and disappointed, but it's important to try to get past that by figuring out what you learned from the situation, and what steps you can take in the future to avoid similar mistakes.  Is there any specific area where you are experiencing shame?  For example, are you blaming yourself for having been abused as a child?\\n\\nHuman: I think I can feel bad about myself when it comes to something. I feel like I did get walked on as a child so there are some of those feelings going on\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

I do have a plan: do you mind if I try to teach you about the topic?\\n\\nHuman: That's fine.\\n\\nAssistant: Well, when you add a number to itself, you get a bigger number.  Let's say you have the number 3.  Then you add the number 3 to itself, which is just 3 + 3, and that would be 6.  Then you add 6 to itself, and that would be 9.  And if you keep adding the number 6 to itself, you get 13, 21, and so on.  Can you write these numbers down?\\n\\nHuman: That is a nice way to explain addition, but what about multiplication?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s a good question.  Multiplication is the same thing, but the numbers you add are the same number that you’re multiplying.  So you can do this to multiply three by itself, or three times three: 3 x 3 = 9.  You can do this with any number, so 3 x 4 is 12.  Can you add a few of these for me?\\n\\nHuman: That makes a lot of sense to me.  I will try it with my child.  Thanks!\\n\\nAssistant:\",\n",

       " 'Human: Why did oil-rich countries form OPEC?\\n\\nAssistant: OPEC was formed in 1960 in order to coordinate the prices of oil between countries that produce oil, and countries that consume oil. This is important because although oil-producing countries have more oil than they need, they are not particularly good at predicting how much will be consumed in the future. In order to mitigate the risk of not having enough oil, it is best to form an organization that is responsible for maintaining the price of oil and thereby insures the oil-producing countries against high prices, which would be bad for the economy.\\n\\nHuman: Who were the founding member nations?\\n\\nAssistant: The founding nations were Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.\\n\\nHuman: Did Venezuela stay in after their revolution?\\n\\nAssistant: Yes, Venezuela did not leave OPEC after their revolution.

In the written test you'll be asked to answer questions, so it might be similar to a quiz you might have in school.  For the parking test, they'll show you how to use your car's parking gear, and they'll use a remote control to move your car forward and backward.  The examiners may also use their remote controls to stop your car when you hit something.  This might seem a bit mean, but it's important to really learn how to stop in a space safely.

If they see anything that's out of the ordinary, they'll get ready to stop your car with their remote, so don't worry if they have a remote.

       " 'Human: How long does it take for a body to mummify?\\n\\nAssistant: It depends on the environment, and on the body. If the body is well-preserved and is not being attacked by microorganisms, it can take millennia. We have documented mummification of several bodies in Egypt and South America, who were buried in very dry climates. In those cases, it took hundreds of years for the bodies to turn into skeletons. The body I am, and want to stay, has always wanted to be a skeleton. The time it took is hard to describe in human time. However, if it could talk, it would say that it took a very long time.\\n\\nHuman: It is just a drying out process?\\n\\nAssistant: That’s a very good question!  Mummification is a very complex process. The first step is desiccation, which happens when the body’s internal organs and bodily fluids dry out.  The next step is decomposition, which happens when bacteria and other microorganisms consume the remains of the body, and break down its components into other materials.  These two processes happen independently of each other, and take place in different times.  If the body is in an environment that is protected from bacterial attacks, the drying out phase can be more rapid.  But the body will also be prevented from being attacked by bacteria, and will not decompose.\\n\\nHuman: So you need to get the organs out of the body?\\n\\nAssistant: Well, the organs aren’t really what is decomposing.  The body’s soft tissues (and everything that is liquid inside the body, for that matter) will go bad and eventually decay into smaller parts.  Bones don’t need any special conditions to survive a very long time.  There’s a famous desert in China called the Taklamakan that has become famous for its desert archaeological sites.  Many people who were buried there were preserved in a way that they’re almost exactly like how they were when they were alive.\\n\\nHuman: Oh. That is so gross!\\n\\nAssistant:',\n",

      "One reason that pandas do not eat meat is that eating meat is not tasty for them [1,2,7]. Another reason that pandas eat bamboo instead of meat is because pandas have a high amount of bacteria in their gut, primarily due to the amount of fiber in bamboo. These bacteria help with the digestion of the bamboo [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]. Pandas can survive on a bamboo-based diet because of their gut flora and the presence of Clostridium bacteria, which have enzymes to break cellulose into simpler sugars [1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]. With the help of these helpful bacteria and the help from the Clostridium, pandas can live as vegetarians [4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12]. This study provides evidence that pandas thrive on a diet of bamboo, and that their gut flora helps them digest this food source easily [1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12].\n",

      "It is possible to maintain mental clarity until death of old age, as shown by the fact that some people do it [1, 2, 3]. The factors that determine whether or not a person will experience a decline in mental capacity are largely biological [5]. In general, the brain shrinks in size as we age, along with some other changes that can affect our ability to encode information into our memory and retrieve it again later [5]. There are also other biological factors that can increase the risk of mental decline, such as the myelin sheath around nerve fibers wearing down and some receptors on the surface of neurons not functioning as well as they once did [5]. On the positive side, the branching of dendrites increases and brain connections strengthen, enabling the brain to detect relationships between diverse sources of information and to understand the global implications of specific issues [5]. Some studies have found that older people can also make fresh brain cells until they are in their 90s, although this production of new neurons decreases in those with Alzheimer's, even when the disease has recently taken hold [4].\n"
