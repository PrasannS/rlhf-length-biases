# A Long Way to Go: Investigating Length Correlations in RLHF

This repo contains code and instructions for reproducing experiments in the paper "A Long Way to Go: Investigating Length Correlations in RLHF" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12950), by Prasann Singhal, Tanya Goyal, Jiacheng Xu, and Greg Durrett. In this work, using both observational and interventional analyses, we find striking relationships with length across all stages of RLHF in 3 open-domain settings. Gains from RLHF may in large part be driven by length increases. 

## Installation

First make sure to set up an environment with Python 3.10, you can then get the necessary installations with 

```
# install normal requirements
# editable install of rlhf_utils with necessary helper code
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd rlhf_utils
pip install -e .
cd ..
```

(NOTE: This README is in progress, check back tomorrow for updated version!)
